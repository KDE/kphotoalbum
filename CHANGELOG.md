KPhotoAlbum 5.10.0 (2023-03-25)
-------------------------------

### Added
 - Allow setting keyboard shortcuts for Date Bar component.
 - Visually differentiate the occupied date range in the date bar by graying out the unoccupied edge areas.

### Changed
 - View-related actions formerly found in the "Settings" menu were moved to the "View" menu.
 - Make options "Display Labels in Thumbnail View" and "Display Categories in Thumbnail View" reachable via the "View" menu
   and allow both actions to be assigned keyboard shortcuts (Implements: #145346).
 - Store the untagged tag information inside the index.xml file instead of the Settings (Implements: #461206).
 - Change scroll direction in the annotation dialog's date edit fields to match common (western) expectations and the date picker.
 - Prevent scrolling past the occupied areas of the date bar.
 - Files are now always created with group read/write permissions (Fixes: #438128).
 - When exiting the demo mode, the demo database is now always saved if it isn't deleted.

### Dependencies
 - CMake: 3.18
 - Qt5: 5.15
 - KDE Frameworks: 5.78

### Fixed
 - Improve readability of "Show Tooltips in Thumbnails Window" tooltip.

KPhotoAlbum 5.9.1 (2022-09-05)
------------------------------

### Fixed
