2004-11-08  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Renamed the menu bar descriptions for locking, so it hopefully
	is easier to understand.

	* update progress dialog for loading info from images after each
	image, rather than after every ten images. This matters if the
	images are say 80Mb large.

--------------------------- version 2.0 released --------------------------------------
	
2004-10-16  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Items in the edit menu (among these "delete image") was
	not available if "display images not on disk" was activated from
	the browser. Thanks to Robert L Krawitz <rlk@alum.mit.edu> for
	finding the bug.

2004-09-26  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Improved date editor: (1) sizing now works (2) there are no
	default buttons, so it is possible to press enter in the line edit
	to specify a date. (3) there now is a ">>" button to copy from
	date to to-date

2004-09-22  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* The editor for image comments now has an on the fly spell checker.

	* BUGFIX: Fixed tab order in the image config dialog.

2004-09-05  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: remove splash screen before showing welcome dialog

2004-09-04  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Added a way to browse directories within the database. Thanks to
	Jean-Michel FAYARD <jmfayard@gmail.com> for patch.

	* BUGFIX: now that it is possible to set background color of
	thumbnail view, the foreground color must also be changed, to
	ensure maximum contrast (and that it is visible at all)

	* No key bindings should be made to letters in the main window, as
	this makes it impossible to press that letter in the browser to jump to
	the item in question. Thus I made these change to key bindings:
	I -> Ctrl+I (show selected images)
	Ctrl-I -> none (show selected images in new window)
	S -> ctrl+R (run slide show)
	Ctrl+S -> none (run randomized slideshow)
	          (this conflicted with save which was and are still on Ctrl-s too)
	Remember you can make your own key bindings in KimDaBa, so this are
	really just the defaults I change.

2004-08-23  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Do not show items already matched when browsing. Thus do not
	show Jesper, if he is already matches in the current browsing scope.

2004-08-09  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* The viewer now preloads images, which makes it feel a LOT more
	responsive.

2004-08-08  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Added zoom out to full view in viewer.

2004-08-07  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Removed the preload hack for preview, which was broken
	anyway. Not needed now when image loading is so much faster.

2004-08-06  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Size of main windows and configuration window are now stored in
	the index.xml file, and restored for future sessions

2004-07-24  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Moved all plugins to one menu rather than scattered out over all
	the menus. The former seems like the best idea for easy finding a
	functionality, while the later seems to be best, to ensure that
	users know which functionality is KimDaBa core features, and which
	are plugins, with plugins perhaps being less integrated than
	build-in features.

	* import/export is improved so during import of external images,
	KimDaBa will first search for the images next to the .kim file,
	and then at the URL the images originally was uploaded to.

2004-07-22  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Made it possible to hide the labels in the thumbnail view

	* Clean up the options dialog (made new group "thumbnail view")

	* Tried to improve the layout of the thumbnail view. This is the
	best I can do, unfortunately QIconView is utterly broken.

2004-07-18  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: search dialog does now contain imported image attributes.

	* Fixed code for going into full screen (This forces the min
	version to be KDE 3.2, though)

2004-07-12  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Automatic generated labels from file names now include all up
	till the last dot (Thanks to Jean-Michel FAYARD
	<boulot.dodo@laposte.net>)

	* Fixed utf-8 encoding description in HTML pages (Thanks to
	Jean-Michel FAYARD <boulot.dodo@laposte.net>)

2004-06-17  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Put count of images in caption of image config window

2004-06-14  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Added the filename to the caption of the viewer.

	* Thanks to Marco Caldarelli <caldarel@yahoo.it> for a patch to
	reread EXIF info, available from a dialog in the menu.

2004-06-13  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Thanks to Marcel Wiesweg <marcel.wiesweg@gmx.de> for a patch for
	optimizing loading in the image property dialog

2004-06-08  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Added a splash screen

2004-06-06  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Bugfix: The time config was not set correctly for configuring
	multiple images, often resulting in many images getting the same
	time stamp.

	* Its now possible to configure which plugins should be loaded.

2004-06-03  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* demo directory are now copied rather than symlinked. With
	symlink, the installed demo files will also be modified when
	images are modified in the demo, which is not desired.

	* Added KIPI support.

2004-05-03  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: When you press cancel during the export process you still get the info
	someone else could import your export. 

	* BUGFIX: After an import the index.xml file was not marked modified

	* BUGFIX: export to HTML page and import resulted in rotated
	images getting even more rotated

	* BUGFIX: importing into a subdirectory did not always work.

2004-05-02  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: KimDaBa crashed in the following situation:
	  - drag an image out from the thumbnail view
	  - browse, so the thumbnail view shows some other images
	  - drag another image out

2004-04-19  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: The wrong image was invoked in the external viewer if
	the thumbnail view was scrolled.

	* BUGFIX: If description was not generated then other option
	groups was not printed in HTML exports.

2004-04-18  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* When opening the image config dialog, show a message box with
	a link to the help page.

	* Made it possible to re enable message boxes where the user
	previously checked do-not-show-again

	* Its now possible to find images where only a set of items are on
	(e.g. only me, and no one else)

	* BUGFIX: When generating HTML, only generate image on disk

	* Added a dialog with a description on how to enable webservers to
	server KimDaBa files.

2004-04-16  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: If the destination directory for HTML export exists,
	offer to remove it. This fixes the problem where it would instead
	just be put in a subdirectory.

	* Loading descriptions from EXIF information can now be disabled

	* BUGFIX: when exporting the image loader also saved the large
	images (like 1024x768) to tumbnails dir. Please remove all
	thumbnails using the maintenance menu item.

	* BUGFIX: images inline in export files was broken if the
	extension was different from .jpg

	* Now its possible to ask for a .kim file on the HTML generated pages

	* BUGFIX: pressing cancel in export dialog still continue exporting.

	* BUGFIX: It was not possible to import twice in one session.

	* BUGFIX: images was rotated too must during export

	* now its possible to export images, and leave the .kim file next
	to the image set rather than putting them into the .kim file. 

2004-04-15  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Its now possible to delete images from within the image
	configuration dialog

	* Now you may click on a .kim file from say konqueror to start
	importing that file into your db.

2004-04-14  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* added Import/Export so its possible to share images with
	friends, without them having to write comments, and tell how is on
	the images.

2004-04-12  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Its now possible to configure the toolbar

	* Added run slide show as a tool button

	* Now its possible to configure the shortcuts in the viewer.

2004-04-11  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* added run randomized slideshow

	* added run slide show to the thumbnail view, thus making it much
	easier to start a slide show if the images in view.

	* Made slide show timeout configurable

	* Made slide show size configurable, plus made it possible to
	specify full screen for configuration for configuration of normal view.

2004-03-27  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* rewrote the handling of dates in the image property dialog, so
	the GUI is much easier to work with - this must have been the
	oldest wish on my which list ;-)

2004-03-21  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Added Images->sort to sort images in thumbnail view. Thanks to
	Thomas Schwarzgruber <possebaer@gmx.at>

	* Added Maintenance->remove all thumbnails and Maintenance->build thumbnails

2004-03-20  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: now we are doing boundary check when panning, so you
	can't pan outside the image.

	* generating HTML and viewing images will now be the context if no
	images are selected. Context is the current search or current
	browse - e.g. all images from say Las Vegas.

2004-03-17  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Added context menu for sorting options listbox 
	(thanks to Reimar Imhof <Reimar.Imhof@netCologne.de> for a patch)

2004-03-10  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: Fixed crash when moving images arround

2004-03-09  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: If you have to rotate an image to view it, you get black stripes besides your 
	image because of the resolution of the image (it's much higher than wide). So 
	far so good. But if you zoom into the image via pressing '+' key, the black 
	stripes don't change -> the shown width stays the same although the 
	(virtually) height changed.
	Thanks to Thomas Schwarzgruber <possebaer@gmx.at> for a patch.

2004-03-07  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: When renaming an item in the listselect, then category
	image is now also renamed.

	* BUGFIX: In the settings dialog, member group tab, ensure that
	the category list is updated when entering the page.

	* replaced "None" with "No Persons", "No Keywords" etc.

	* the count text in the browser is now "categories" rather than
	"images" when displaying categories like "persons", "locations" etc.

	* BUGFIX: Finally made panning work. Its now bound to the middle
	mouse button, which is more compatible to a wide range of
	application, rather than Ctrl+left button as was the case
	previously.

2004-03-02  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: previous fix to member groups was broken.

	* use smoothScale rather than scale to get better looking thumbnails.

2004-02-15  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: Pressing the rename button in member groups made
	KimDaBa crash if no member groups are selected.

--------------------------- version 1.1 released --------------------------------------

2004-02-04  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: description on index page was controlled by
	"description" checkbox rather than the description for each page

2004-02-01  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: option groups was not available for translations.

	* BUGFIX: the string **NONE** was not made available for
	translation everywhere, which resulted in the search dialog did
	not work for translated languages.

2004-01-31  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: changed viewer from QDialog to QWidget as base class so
	the browser window could get on top of it.

2004-01-29  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Made the image preview size configurable.

	* Ensure enable/disable state of menu bar is correct

2004-01-27  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Made the KimDaBa properties dialog look better.

2004-01-26  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: Changed QActions to KActions in the viewer to avoid mem
	error when the viewer closes.

	* BUGFIX: Fixed bug introduced yesterday, where rotating multiple
	images resulting in them getting an odd angle.

2004-01-25  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Split up the dialog for HTML generation, plus made it possible
	to specify which of the option groups (Persons/Location/...) plus
	description - to generate.

	* The image configuration dialog may now be closed by pressing Ctrl+return

	* Added a number of tooltips

	* Added a donate dialog, which makes it possible for people to
	donate money.

	* BUGFIX: when generating HTML, its no longer a problem if several
	images have the same base name, ie. if you may now generate
	holiday1/me.jpg andd holiday2/me.jpg at the same time.

	* BUGFIX: When the user presses the right mouse button on one of
	the list boxes containing options (Persons, Loactions, Keywords
	etc.) to show the context menu, then the state of the item was
	changed (from selected to non-selected or visa versa).

	* The total amount of images in the status bar is now updated when
	new images are found or existing images are deleted.

	* BUGFIX: don't load the search and multi-config images through
	the imageinfo clas as this will make KimDaBa ask whether date
	should be trusted.

	* Added a configuration option for whether EXIF rotation
	information should be used or not.

2004-01-23  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: It was not possible to generate HTML more than once per session.

	* Read date, orientation and description out of EXIF data.

2004-01-21  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Thanks to Teemu Rytilahti <teemu.rytilahti@kde-fi.org>, KimDaBa
	will now offer themes when generating HTML.

	* Heavily optimized browsing functions. Now everything is
	hopefully lightning fast.

2004-01-20  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* The thumbnail overview and the image viewer now has a menu item
	for invoking an external program on the images. The list includes
	all programs claiming they can handle image/jpeg from KTrader.

	* Implemented Maintenance/Display Images not on Disk

	* Implemented Maintenance/Recalculate Checksum (Useful if images
	has been change for example using gimp)

	* Implemented Maintenance/Rescan for new Images

	* Only do auto save if there has been changes since the last auto save.

2004-01-19  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* MD5 sums are now calculated for each image, so that KimDaBa can
	track movement of images in the directories

2004-01-18  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Move cursor to the lower right corner when viewer goes into fullscreen mode

	* BUGFIX: Generate HTML with nothing selected now export all
	images from thumbnail view.

	* BUGFIX: Context menu for thumbnail view used to show up in the
	browser too.

	* BUGFIX: searches using the textbox didn't work.

	* BUGFIX: ensure that tip of the day has focus when it starts up.

2004-01-10  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Improved HTML generation.

2004-01-04  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* The tool tip for the thumbnail view now contains an enlargement
	of the image. In addition the tool tip needs to be disabled,
	rather than it automatically hides. The tool tip window will
	temporarily hide when the mouse is outside the thumbnail view.
	The placement of the tool tip window is now improved, so it
	doesn't get partly of screen.

2004-01-03  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Added an item to the context menu in the viewer for setting the
	current image as the background. (Thanks to Teemu Rytilahti
	<teemu.rytilahti@kde-fi.org>) for a patch with this feature.

	* New Feature: It is now possible to show the content views (those
	with overview of persons, locations, keywords etc) either with a
	list view or with an icon view. In addition it is also possible to
	show a different icon for each item (one icon for Joe, and another
	for Bill).

2003-12-30  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: Member groups are not shown in the browser, in case the
	member group do not contain any items.

2003-12-26  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Update thumnail view when an image has been rotated.

	* Added "View Selected" and "View Selected in new window" to the
	context menu for the thumbnail overview.

	* Enable/Disable state of "configure property items" are now correctly set.

	* On public demand, the file name is now shown in the status bar.

2003-12-13  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: fixed crash where KimDaBa crashes if you right click outside
	an item in one of the list boxes with properties (Persons,
	Locations, ...)

2003-12-05  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: KimDaBa used to crash on moving images around.

2003-12-01  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* New Feature: Its now possible to drag(copy) images from kimdaba
	to say the desktop. Unfortunately KimDaBa crashes in KDE code if I
	drag an QImage out, so I can only drag the filename out, which
	means that rotated images are not rotated when dragged out. Still
	better than nothing ;-)


	* Go out of full screen if an item from the info box in the viewer
	is selected, and the viewer is on the same monitor as the browser.

	* Added Settings | Configure Shortcuts

	* Edit->Options was moved Settings->Configure Kimdaba.

	* New Feature: It is now possible to using fish:// or ftp:// when
	exporting to HTML

	* BUGFIX: Don't show HTML export dialog in case no item was selected.

---------------------------------- version 1.0 released --------------------
2003-11-27  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: Previously the image loader was asked to load all images
	on start up, making machines with low memory crash. This was
	clearly unintentional, and as such a bug.

2003-11-21  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: indicator marks are now properly shown during selection
	of drawing on images.

2003-11-13  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: File names did not contain an extension in the ThumbNail
	directory. This resulted in a name class if two files existed with
	same base name but different extension.

	* Completed the KimDaBa handbook.

	* BUGFIX: KimDaBa did always show one image less than the index promised.

	* IMPROVEMENT: Exchanged Ctrl+plus and Ctrl+minus in the viewer, so ctrl+plus
	now means run faster and ctrl+minus means run slower. This seems
	much more intuitive.

2003-10-21  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: First search for an image, then set properties, and the
	app crashed.

2003-10-05  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: KimDaBa crashed when it found new images at start up.

	* Started writing a handbook for KimDaBa.

	* BUGFIX: if the slideshow was running very fast, then keyevents got utterly much
	  behind making it almost impossible to stop the slideshow.

	* Its now possible to configure image properties from within the viewer.

2003-10-04  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Added new feature, which allows you to specify a default search
	option, that applies to all searches. That way you can exclude all
	private images, when looking at images with say, your parents.

	* BUGFIX: If a user added a new group, but never added any items
	to the group, then the group would not be available later for
	adding new items, but it was still available for selecting in
	configuration listbox and for searching.

	* BUGFIX: When a group was renamed or delete, the old name would still be
	available in the configuration listbox.

	* Added status bar icon for dirtyness.

	* BUGFIX: In the image config, selecting an item from the listbox
	did not mark the image dirty.

	* BUGFIX: Pressing Cancel in the find dialog, does no longer
	change the content of the browser window.
