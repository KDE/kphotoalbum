2009-11-08  Hassan Ibraheem <hasan.ibraheem@gmail.com>

	* fixed bug #211392: Incorrect rotation angle after annotating multiple
	 images.Thanks to Andreas Neustifter.
====================== KPhotoalbum 4.1 released  ===================================	

2009-09-02  Miika Turkia <theBro@luukku.com>

	* Redirecting with no index.html in URL added and cleaned up
	  some comments in the theme darkJS

2009-08-28  Jan Kundr√°t  <jkt@flaska.net>

	* Fix segfaults when dragging images before the first one and after the last
	one

2009-08-15  Hassan Ibraheem   <hasan.ibraheem@gmail.com>

	* fixed bug #171520: preview images when annotating multiple
	images at once

2009-08-14  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@kdab.com>

	* Improved zooming in rotated images (by Hassan Ibraheem)

2009-07-25  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@kdab.com>

	* Show the file list directly in the Read Exif Info
	dialog. Previously it was a secondary dialog, with a
	do-not-show-again checkbox and a cancel button (none of those two
	made any sense there)

2009-07-20  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@kdab.com>

	* Add a keybinding for delete in the viewer that will take the
	image of the display list. This is useful when comparing a number
	of images and want to take the worst one away every time to find
	the best one. Thanks to Wes Hardaker <wes@hardakers.net> for a
	patch implementing this.

2009-07-19  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@kdab.com>

	* Now it is possible to chose the thumbnail storage format from
	the settings dialog (ppm files which we used by default are pretty
	large, so on limited disk space you may wish to choose jpg instead
	to trade some speed for disk space. (thanks to Franck Sicard
	<franck.sicard@3demi.net> for a patch for this)

	* To move items around in the thumbnail viewer, you now first have
	to select them, then move them. This makes it so much easier to
	select items, as you do not have to find an empty space to start.

	* Once more updated the look of the icons in the thumbnail
	viewer. This time I copied the look and fell from Gwenview, which
	I hope everyone will like.

	* Refactored the code of the thumbnail viewer, so it now is much
	more clean and understandable.

2009-07-14  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@kdab.com>

	* Thumbnail view icons are now square again, and background color
	is customizable. The default has changed slightly, so the
	background color is dark gray, and spacing are 4 pixels. This
	gives IMHO the best 3D effect.

2009-07-24  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@kdab.com>

	* fixed bug #201116: kphotoalbum crashes when trying to remove image without deleting from disk

2009-07-12  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@kdab.com>

	* Exif database insertion works again. Thanks to Matthias Fussel

2009-07-12  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@kdab.com>

	* Fixed bug #199629 - new images don't trigger dirty state, thanks
	to mat.fuessel@gmx.net

	* Fixed bug #150971 - disable too low zoom levels, thanks to alexjironkin@gmail.com

2009-07-11  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@kdab.com>

	* Now it is possible to add a category image from a context menu,
	which makes that process much faster (this fixes bug
	#195023). Thanks to Thomas Pircher for the work on that.

2009-07-10  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@kdab.com>

	* Resizing the category overview page now is done without the
	actual thumbnails, that makes it much faster and much more smooth
	* Removed a lot of includes that was either no longer needed, or
	which at least could be replaced with a forward declaration.
	* Improved focus handling in the annotation dialog

2009-07-07  Hassan Ibraheem <hasan.ibraheem@gmail.com>
      * Added support for searching by rating.

2009-07-05  Miika Turkia <theBro@luukku.com>

	* Automatic redirection to smallest image sizes for theme dark
	JavaScript. Now the theme in question views smallest images on page
	and biggest images when the thumbnail or full sized image is clicked.

2009-07-04  Miika Turkia <theBro@luukku.com>

	* bugfix: taking video files into account in HTML generation in
	JavaScript part (show thumbnail instead of video file).

	* Having full size image in the JS array instead of pagename for same
	sized imagepage.

	* Support for storing most of the settings (all relevant) of
	HTMLGallery.

	* Support for default theme (Default=true in kphotoalbum.theme file)

	* Added theme "Dark JavaScript" - if JavaScript is supported images
	are shown using it on main page - this is the default theme

2009-07-03  Hassan Ibraheem <hasan.ibraheem@gmail.com>
        * Added support for rating multiple images at once in the annotation
          dialog.

2009-07-01  Miika Turkia <theBro@luukku.com>

	* fixed bug #197107: Generated HTML pages have empty theme name and
	theme author.

2009-06-29  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@kdab.com>

	* Made it much more explicit when done tagging images:
	  - An item for showing images not yet tagged are available in the
	    browser
	  - A configuration option is available for specifying which
            category and tag should be used to specify untagged images.
	  - This tag is set on images when loaded in
	  - This tag is removed when selecting "done tagging" in the
            annotation dialog. It is also possible to select "continue
	    later" in that dialog

2009-06-22  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@kdab.com>

	* Speed up browsing of categories with many sub categories. This
	took browsing from the order of magnitude of half minutes to a second.

	* Added new theme for HTML pages which includes improved support
	using java script. (Thanks to Miika Turkia for a patch for this)

	* Added support for a copyright tag on the HTML generated pages
	(Thanks to Miika Turkia for a patch for this)

2009-06-21  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@kdab.com>

	* When AnnotationDialog is called with multiple images, show
	selected only shows also partially selected items. Thanks to
	Hassan Ibraheem for patch.

	* fixed bug #171517: Repopulate categories lists whenever an image
	is loaded. Thanks to Hassan Ibraheem for patch.

2009-06-16  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@kdab.com>

	* fixed issue #196095 - Add icon for hide non selected. Thanks to
	Hassan Ibraheem for patch.

2009-06-14  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@kdab.com>

	* fixed bug #165742: ListSelect blanks out when typing an initial
	letter that does not match. Thanks to Hassan Ibraheem for the patch for this.

	* fixed bug #167045: add ENTER as search dialog tag auto
	completion key. Thanks to Hassan Ibraheem for the patch for this.

	* bug fix: The remove token dialog was broken second time it was
	brought up.

	* fixed bug #186708 - Tokens can not be access from the annotation dialog

2009-06-10  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@kdab.com>

	* Somehow the XML database can get a file loaded twice. As a
	remedy until we find the real bug, we will ignore the new files
	when they are loaded from the database. Thanks to Franck Sicard
	for a patch for this

2009-06-08  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@kdab.com>

	* New images was not correctly inserted into the exif database
	(thanks to Bart Visscher for a patch that fixes this.)
	Please rerun "Maintainance->Recreate Exif Search Database" to
	ensure your database it working again.

2009-06-02  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@kdab.com>

	* Reworked the browser completely, which has the following
	consequences:
	  * Many of the changes are internal restructuring of the code to
	    use Model/View
	  * The GUI is now using Qt4 classes, which looks much more sexy
	  * When limiting the content using the line edit, it will try and
	    be clever about which branches are open
	  * When limiting, all items of a sub category are shown if its
            parent matches. As an example of this, imagine a super
	    category California, with sub categories Las Vegas and Los
	    Angeless. If you type California in the search line edit, then
	    both children will still be shown
	  * The search bar will now keep focus all the time and send
            movement keys to the browser. This makes it easier to narrow
	    in the browser using the searchbar.
	  * The overview page is now shown in icon mode with icons centered

2009-05-31  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@kdab.com>

	* Avoid crash in case "make install" was not executed.

====================== KPhotoalbum 4.0.1 released  ===================================	

Other changes done since 4.0

	* Fix compilation with new Marble and armel (Marble changed API
	again)
	* fixed bug #186807 - no cancel button in "create own database
	dialog"
	* fixed bug #192385 - it was not possible to hide items in the
	annotation between sessions.


2009-05-13  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@kdab.com>

	* Changed default shortcut for copy from previous image in the
	annotation dialog to Alt+insert, as control+insert was eaten by
	the line edits, and the shortcut did thus not work when they had
	the keyboard focus.

	* BUGFIX: The HTML generator did not display the available themes
	correctly. Thanks to Miika Turkia for a patch for this.

2009-05-11  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@kdab.com>

	* BUGFIX: Invoke external application for multiple files did not
	work. Thanks to Miika Turkia for a patch for this.

====================== KPhotoalbum 4.0 released  ===================================	
	
Previous changes

	* Add a simple method for marking current image as a "head of
	stack", ie. the one to show
	
	* Fix abort() on shift-click to the middle of ThumbnailWidget
	right after program start
	
	* For some reason konsole doesn't accept drops and pastes of
	QUrls, so I encode as a plain string list in addition.
	
	* Invalide date finder dialog has now been improved slightly (the config dialog is hidden as soon as it is OK, so we can see theprogress dialog)

	* fixed bug #164199 - thumbnail label is chopped
	
	* fixed bug #167036 - kipi-plugins not installed; plugins menu still available but empty
	
	* Stopped leaking memory/threads when viewing video

	* fixed bug #164587 - KPA crashes when deleteing an image from the annotation dialog.

2009-03-08  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@kdab.com>

	* Saving the toolbar now works again, including showing icons only.

	* Generate HTML is now working again.

2009-02-23  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@kdab.com>

	* Removed the code for setting an image as wall paper (That has
	not yet been ported to KDE 4)

2009-02-21  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@kdab.com>

	* In the video viewer, it is now possible to zoom the image.

	* seeking in the video widget is now working

====================== Snapshot 11/2-2009  ===================================	

2008-09-19  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Removed the survey.

2008-09-15 Henner Zeller <h.zeller@acm.org>

	* Implement thumbnail precaching of the next/previous page.

2008-09-07  Jan Kundrat  <jkt@gentoo.org>

	* Image rating (KRatingWidget, that stars thingy)

2008-09-05  Jan Kundrat  <jkt@gentoo.org>

	* Image stacking -- grouping somehow related images together

2008-09-01  Jan Kundrat  <jkt@gentoo.org>

	* Remove flickering in the ThumbnailView

2008-08-30  Jan Kundrat  <jkt@gentoo.org>

	* Fix recognition of video files whose name contains more than one dot

2008-07-22  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* new icons for the default categories. These icons will now by
	default be used in case the icon specified in the setup does not
	exists - this will help users migrating from KDE3 KPA to KDE4
	version, where the default installed icons have changed.

2008-07-20  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Keywords has now been replaced with Events in the default setup
	that people will get when they create a new database.

2008-07-17  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* (regression) The text editor in the annotation dialog now offers
	spell checking again - actually it is a completely new widget.

2008-07-16  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* (regression) the search bar is now correctly highlighted again.

	* New feature: The import dialog will now check if an image already exists in
	the DB with the same MD5 sum, and offer to merge the information
	about the images.

2008-07-14  Jan Kundrat  <jkt@gentoo.org>

	* Improve the concept of "priorities" for image loading
	
	* Use all CPUs we have to decode images in parallel -- we're now SMP
	friendly

	* Preload image thumbnails from images in the thumbnail viewer even if they
	aren't visible yet

2008-07-13  Jan Kundrat  <jkt@gentoo.org>

	* exiv2 upstream changed their API

2008-07-10  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Added Maintenance->Statistics dialog, which shows a bit of
	statistics about your annotations.

2008-07-06  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* (regression) Images was not downloaded when importing from a
	remote URL.

	* When generating a .kim file together with HTML, the URL written
	into the .kim file did not include the destination directory. This
	had the result that images could not be found if the .kim file was
	copied locally.

	* If there are not categories in import file, it was not possible
	to complete the import dialog.

	* (regression) When loading images using the import dialog, it
	would ask if you trust date and time from Exif info. This is not
	needed, as the info from the import file will be used instead.

	* Don't show "Media Type" in the Import Dialog

	* (regression) The import dialog now correctly show new items with
	red, and select them in the combobox.

2008-06-23  Jan Kundrat  <jkt@gentoo.org>

	* Use all CPU cores for parallelization of image loading

2008-06-22  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Replace linear search in XMLImageDateCollection with range
	index. This means that the datebar will update way faster, making
	the whole application faster. Thanks to Henner Zeller.
	
	* (regression) Focus now works in the annotation dialog
	again.
	

	* Improved display of ranges in datebar of Henner Zeller

2008-06-21  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Speed up populating the datebar with a factor of 4. Before it
	took 6 seconds to delete an image due to that, now it only take
	1.5 second on my machine. This speed up should also be there for
	any operation that changes the amount of images shown in the datebar.

2008-06-20  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* A warning dialog came up complaining about images not being
	sorted in case one of the images did not have a date.
	* Sorting images did not work.

2008-06-19  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* (regression bug) Settings was not syncs correct (esp the info
	about where the database was located was not saves)

	* Don't offer to show videos on start up. Instead there now is an
	entry in the menu.

 	* Exif/Database.cpp (offerInitialize): Don't offer to populate the
	exiv database anymore, this was really only needed when people
	upgraded to the last major version.
 

2008-06-18  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Feature test dialog is no more offered during start up, but is
	instead part of the "welcome to KPA dialog".

	* Exif/SearchDialog.cpp (makeCamera): (regression bug) Exif info
	search -> Database did not scroll. Now it does. Also if no cameras
	are found, it will now tell you so instead of just showing an
	empty window.

2008-06-15  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Deleting an image that was no longer on disk resulted in an
	error dialog telling that it could not be deleted. Now it will
	just act as if it did actually delete it, and take the image out
	of the database.

	* AnnotationDialog/ListSelect.cpp: The context menu for adding
	super categories from the image annotation dialog had the problem
	that the ampersand added by KDE would be in its name, so it would
	e.g. be named &Berlin

2008-05-17  Jan Kundrat  <jkt@gentoo.org>

	* XMLDB/FIleReader.cpp: Don't crash on parsing XML files with empty supergroups
	* XMLDB/Database.cpp: Should ignore empty strings, too

2008-03-26  Jan Kundrat  <jkt@gentoo.org>

	* Support localized month names in the KDateEdit properly

2008-03-15  Jan Kundrat  <jkt@gentoo.org>

	* Support different charsets when displaying EXIF/IPTC metadata

2008-02-20  Jan Kundrat  <jkt@gentoo.org>

	* Get list of supported Exif tags directly from the Exiv2 library.

2008-02-13  Jan Kundrat  <jkt@gentoo.org>

	* Add Edit->Open List of Files menu that shows list of thumbnails that
	matches user-entered stuff.

2008-02-01  Jan Kundrat  <jkt@gentoo.org>

	* Expand sensitive area of a thumbnail image to the whole cell (including
	  category listing)

2007-11-25  Jan Kundrat  <jkt@gentoo.org>

	* Use QWidget::showFullScreen() and showNormal() instead of hacky way of
	KWin::setState( winId(), NET::FullScreen ) (bug #151031)

	* Raise images/thumbnail cache limit to 4GB. Too bad KDE/Qt offers no
	portable way to get information about total available memory of a system.
	(Bug 151584)

2007-11-06  Jan Kundrat  <jkt@gentoo.org>

	* Robert Krawitz: Fixed regression introduced in 720309 where Viewer adds
	requests with too high priority. Images to be preloaded were in fact
	scheduled for decoding before the first image.
	This should be converted to proper priority queue later...

2007-10-08  Jan Kundrat  <jkt@gentoo.org>

	* Better error handling in KIM Import
	* Better interactivity in KIM Import

2007-10-03  Jan Kundrat  <jkt@gentoo.org>

	* Give Viewer's requests for images higher priority than thumbnails have

2007-10-01  Jan Kundrat  <jkt@gentoo.org>

	* Adjust the extension of images generated for HTML export. Based on a patch
	submitted by Miika Turkia <mturkia@nixu.fi>.

	* Fix behaviour of thumbnail selecting with keyboard. Fixes bug 149706.

2007-08-18  Jan Kundrat  <jkt@gentoo.org>

	* Use libkdcraw intead of budled and rotten dcraw copy

2007-08-11  Jan Kundrat  <jkt@gentoo.org>

	* Automatically hide mouse cursor and disable screensaver when in Viewer

2007-08-10  Jan Kundrat  <jkt@gentoo.org>

	* Add Edit->Copy for copying a list of URLs to selected images to clipboard.
	Fixes bug 145628 for a second time :).

2007-08-09  Jan Kundrat  <jkt@gentoo.org>

	* Rename File->Export to File->Export/Copy Images to reflect what it
	actually does and reduce confusion. Fixes bug 145628.

2007-08-08  Jan Kundrat  <jkt@gentoo.org>

	* Applied Henner Zeller's patch for optimizing the thumbnail displaying
	queue complexity from O(n^2) to O(n*log n)

2007-07-23  Jan Kundrat  <jkt@gentoo.org>

	* Applied Robert Krawitz' patch for using readdir_r() instead of QDir
	for performance reasons

2007-06-26  Jan Kundrat  <jkt@gentoo.org>

	* Support PEF, a raw format from Pentax' DSLRs.

2007-06-16  Jan Kundrat  <jkt@gentoo.org>

	* Display a warning instead of black screen when current image can't
	be shown in the Viewer

	* Stop video playback before seeking to another image

	* Changed MainWindow::Window::selectedOnDisk() to return list of
	images available in current view if selection is empty and reworked
	Viewer not to check for file availability before it's really needed

2007-06-11  Tuomas Suutari  <thsuut@utu.fi>

	* Do not show -1 x -1 image sizes at all. And as suggested by
	Henner Zeller do not show mega pixel number if it is 0.0.

2007-06-10  Jan Kundrat  <jkt@gentoo.org>

	* Use another dialog for deleting files. Patch submited by Christoph
	Moseler <forums@moseler.net>.

	* Allow re-using of tags from the previously tagged image in the
	annotation dialog (first part of bug #145158)

2007-05-23  Jan Kundrat  <jkt@gentoo.org>

	* Make "show this image" fast again.

2007-05-19  Jan Kundrat  <jkt@gentoo.org>

	* Recognize .flv and .erf files -- Fixes bugs 145366 and 141877.

2007-05-19  Jan Kundrat  <jkt@gentoo.org>

	pressing Ctrl+A optional.  Thanks to Shawn Willden for nice comments
	and Baptiste Mathus for review.
	Fixes bug 145309.

2007-05-10  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Make it possible to configure the aspect ratio in the thumbnail
	viewer - thanks to Jan Kundrat

2007-05-09  Tuomas Suutari  <thsuut@utu.fi>

	* Store filenames in Exif database using UTF-8 encoding. Thanks
	to Jan Kundrat for a patch.

2007-05-04  Tuomas Suutari  <thsuut@utu.fi>

	* Make selection more visible in thumbnail view.

	* Apply Henner Zeller's patch to allow changing background color
	of the thumbnail view black.

2007-05-02  Tuomas Suutari  <thsuut@utu.fi>

	* Apply Henner Zeller's patch to fix some ImageRequest memory
	leaks.

2007-04-29  Tuomas Suutari  <thsuut@utu.fi>

	* Apply Henner Zeller's patch to show SizeAllCursor when pressing
	info box with mouse.

2007-04-23  Shawn Willden  <shawn@willden.org>

	bug that sometimes prevented a selected thumbnail to be added into
	internal selection list.

2007-03-31  Tuomas Suutari  <thsuut@utu.fi>

	* Bugfix: In member group tab of the configuration dialog, when
	changing category from the dropdown list, items from a different
	category were sometimes added to members listbox.

2007-02-28  Tuomas Suutari  <thsuut@utu.fi>

	* Bugfix: Selection was ignored in the first press of the Plugins
	menu item, if plugin loading was delayed.

2007-02-04  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* It is now possible to search for images with changed MD5 sum -
	very useful for searching for corrupted image files.

2007-01-13  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Limit extra space in thumbnail viewer when showing categories

====================== Snapshot Monday 27/11-2006  ===================================	

2006-11-27  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Save configurations of special categories (should they be shown
	in the viewer etc) (Thanks to Christoph Moseler)

	* Bugfix: when going out of full screen mode, resize to the
	configured size. (Thanks to Henner Zeller)

	* Bugfix: better error handling for video loading (thx to Henner Zeller)

2006-11-26  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Renamed Persons to People and Locations to Places. A huge thank
	you to Clytie Siddall clytie AT riverland DOT net DOT au for
	bringing this and numerous other language errors to my attention.

	* Instead of showing "No other Persons" show "None". Translated
	versions had problems as the "No other" part depended on the category.

2006-11-19  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Bugfix: In the settings dialog you were asked if you really
	wanted to delete a category. Despite your answer it would be
	deleted nevertheless. (Thanks to Baptiste Mathus for finding this).

	* Do not show image size for videos (currently there are not way
	to get that information from the KDE video subsystem)

2006-11-18  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Show mega pixel in info box, and zoom factor in viewer, thx to Henner Zeller

	* Fixed problem with windows layout not being read correctly if
	any category name contains non-latin1 character

====================== Snapshot Wednesday 15/11-2006  ===================================	
	
2006-11-14  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Bugfix: Recent added code to ensure that the splash screen would
	update timely broke the size of the main dialog.

2006-11-12  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Directories only show the filename part now in the browser
	category directories. (Thanks to Christoph Moseler)

	* BUGFIX: Finally nailed down the bug where the annotation dialog
	did not show the first image preview.

	* Improved support for the flickr plug-in. Now tags are correctly
	uploaded. Thanks to Mark Jaroski for a patch.

2006-11-11  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* An item may be member of a number of categories. Mike may be a member of coworkers and friends.
	Selecting the item in one subcategory, should select him in
	all.

	* New option to show categories in the thumbnail view. Now it is
	also possible to set tokens directly in the thumbnail view. Thanks
	to (Thanks to Christoph Moseler)

	* Bugfix: Searching for description did not work (Thx to Christoph
	Moseler for finding the bug)

	* control + scroll now zoom on the datebar. (Thanks to Benjamin
	Bock for a patch)

	* Bugfix: Full screen viewer no longer worked very well after the
	change to loading only the size as needed. The reason for this was
	a race condition where the image was loaded before the window had
	sized it self.

	* Somehow running the viewer always forced it to show in a new
	window, that was definitely against the design.

	* Don't try and run a slide show if only one image is
	selected. Doing so will change zoom preference each time we try to
	go to the next image.

2006-11-08  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Improved video backend detection. Thanks to  Robert L Krawitz

====================== Snapshot Tuesday 7/11-2006  ===================================	

2006-11-06  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Reworked the pixel by pixel zoom, so it doesn't flicker the real
	sized image first.I beleive that pixel by pixel zoom now works in
	the reworked version. 

	As an added bonus, I no longer loads the first image in full size, but
	only in viewer size. This has given a significant boost in
	starting up the viewer. If the user ever zooms, then the real
	sized image is loaded in the background and put in place when it
	is available - until then the user just sees the viewer sized
	version he was original looking at. 

2006-11-05  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Right clicking on an image should select it.

	* Stop slideshow when we hit a video, so we don't advance in the
	middle of the video.

	* Implemented Play/Pause/Stop/Restart for videos

	* Now Video playback also works with kaffein and kaboodle

2006-11-04  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Enabling/Disabling the right items in the context menu in the
	viewer depending on image vs. video.

	* Zooming now works with video display.

	* Improved info when videos can't be loaded.

2006-10-29  Jesper K. Pederse  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Show splash screen during database loading phase (thx to
	Christoph Moseler for finding this)

	* More video format tests.

	* The feature dialog now test if we can show video thumbnails.

	* The feature dialog now tests better to see if we can show
	videos.

	* New application icon

	* BUGFIX: Yet another attempt at fixing that darn inputting date bug.

====================== Snapshot Sunday 23/10-2006  ===================================	

2006-10-22  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* It is now possible to bring up the exif dialog from the viewer.

	* Bugfix: The numbered backup had by accident included the
	extension .zip for the index.xml file inside the zip file. (Thanks
	to Baptiste MATHUS for reporting).

	* Bugfix: Translated version of KPA would display image dates in
	English, but expect month input in the translated language. This
	has now been fixed so it expected input in English too.

	* Bugfix: The panes in the annotation dialog would not show up correctly
	in translated version of KPhotoAlbum.

2006-10-05  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Bugfix: Database was marked as dirty when it started up.

	* Moved XML settings into Backend tab in the settings page. It
	really belongs here.

	* On public demand: made it possible to disable the splash screen.

	* New splash screen.

2006-09-25  Jesper K. Pederse  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Use alternate EXIF reading code in case EXIV2 is not installed.

====================== Snapshot Sunday 24/9-2006  ===================================	

2006-09-24  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Warn the user at start up if not all features are installed.

	* Fix up the sub category page in the annotation dialog.

	* Programmers point of view: The whole setup of marking the
	database dirty have been reworked. Now we just have a
	MainWindow::DirtyIndicator::markDirty(). This makes it easier to
	mark the DB dirty.
	Users point of view: Now drawing on images, and changing sub
	categories marks the DB dirty.
	

2006-09-23  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Only write description element to the database if there is a description.

	* Do not allow the user to change sub categories for special
	categories (Just imagine he changed the directory structure shown
	using sub categories - he would get utterly confused from this,
	I'm sure) (Thanks to Christoph Moseler for pointing this out)

	* Do not allow the user to change the icon for special categories
	(Folder, Tokens, .. ). It doesn't add any value to them to be able
	to do so, and it just clutters up the dialog. (Thanks to Christoph
	Moseler for pointing this out).

	* Now that sub categories are shown with indentation, don't show a
	special icons for the super categories any more.

2006-09-17  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: Fixed a crash happening when saving after a category had
	been renamed, and that category was included in the privacy
	settings.
	
	* BUGFIX: When renaming a category also rename the category
	thumbnails. (Thanks to Christoph Moseler for finding this)

2006-09-16  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: The last snapshot had a bug where KPA would crash if you
	right clicked, in the annotation dialogs listbox, outside of any
	items. (Thanks to Christoph Moseler for finding this)

	* BUGFIX: Privacy info was not properly loaded.

	* BUGFIX: Changing the label for an image in the annotation dialog
	did not result in the label being updated in the thumbnail
	view. (Thanks to Christoph Moseler for finding this)

	* BUGFIX: Yet another fix to the selection code in the thumbnail
	viewer. What was broken in the latest snapshot was that you where
	not able to select a number of images, and drag them.

2006-09-09  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: delete and rename of item in the annotation dialog
	didn't work if the item was not top level or it had sub items.

	* Added "remove item from parent category" to the list box in the
	annotation dialog, to allow the user to make a sub item top level.

	* Ensure every action's keybinding in the viewer is configurable
	(Thanks to Kimball Robinson for bringing it to my attention that
	they were not)

	* Disabled "Create Subcategory..." item when right mouse button
	was click outside any items (this coursed a crash). Thanks to
	Christoph Moseler <forums@moseler.net> for finding this.


====================== Snapshot Wednesday 6/9-2006  ===================================	

2006-09-01  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* The checkboxes in the annotation dialog are now tristate, which
	means that there are no need for the "merge" and "remove"
	checkboxes.
	Also the "and" checkbox has been replaced with an "and" and a "or"
	radio button to make their meaning more understandable.

	* BUGFIX: Solved this crash: edit a category name in the settings
	dialog, press Apply and press OK. (thanks to Christoph Moseler
	<forums@moseler.net> for finding this.

====================== Snapshot Sunday 27/8-2006 ===================================	

2006-08-27  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Tokens got kind of lost when importing from a KPhotoAlbum 2.2 index file.

	* BUGFIX: Media Type Category was not filled correctly when finding new images.

	* It is now possible to set up sub categories in the annotation
	dialog, simply by dragging items onto other items.

2006-08-26  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* The listbox in the annotation dialog is now updated when an item is added as a sub item to another.

	* Improved set of file names recognized as videos.

	* BUGFIX: deselect all images when right clicking on an image that
	is currently not selected.

2006-08-25  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* It is now possible to use the search bar in the main window,
	when showing folders.

	* Searching in a list view in the browser is not anchored to the
	beginning of the word.

	* BUGFIX: It is now possible to have spaces in category names.

	* Fixed bug in last snapshot where the compressed index.xml didn't
	work.

	* Don't save Folders to the index.xml file again. I'm rather sure
	it is faster to calculate the info on start up rather than loading
	the extra XML.

====================== Snapshot Wednesday 23/8-2006 ===================================	

2006-08-23  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Now it is also possible to bind rotate left/right in the
	annotation dialog.

	* Added a Media Type folder.

2006-08-21  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Bugfix: Selection using the shift key and mouse button was
	broken if selected spanned several pages.

	* Bugfix: Pressing the mouse down on a selected image in the
	thumbnail viewer now deselect all other images if control or shift
	is not pressed. This was an inconsistent behavior compared to
	similar browsers.

	* Bugfix: holding control down in the browser when selecting an
	item (say a person), should jump directly to the images rather
	than going back to main browser window. This did not work.

2006-08-20  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* now it is possible to specify the icon size in used in the
	browser - esp usefull for showing larger images for persons in an
	icon view.

	* Added an info box which suggest people to see the introduction
	videos.

	* KPhotoAlbum is now capable of also managing videos.

2006-08-14  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* The list boxes in the AnnotationDialog now has an accelerator.

2006-08-13  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Added function to thumbnail context bar to regenerate thumbnails,
	useful when the video thumbnail generator picks a random image for
	thumbnail.

2006-08-11  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* It is now possible to configure the key bindings in the
	annotation dialog.

2006-08-10  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* In the viewer it is now possible to use mouse wheel to scroll to
	the next/prev image. (Thanks to Christoph Moseler for a patch).

2006-07-23  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Make it possible to set a category image for sub categories.

	* Show the category tree in the browser

2006-07-22  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* A new menu item now exist in the annotation dialogs context
	menu, namely "Add Sub Category"

	* In the annotation dialog, you may now switch between sorted
	category view and most recent view, by pressing and releasing the
	alt key.

	* In the annotation dialog, pressing and releasing the control
	will toggle showing items selected, only.

2006-07-14  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* In the annotation dialog, it is now possible to scroll the list
	of selected items, but pressing arrow up and down.

	when searching. Thanks to Martin Hoeller for finding this crash.

2006-03-26  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Bugfix: inaccurate times now survives a visit to the annotation dialog.

	* Bugfix: Member maps wasn't correctly renamed when renaming a category.

	* Save the layout of the annotation dialog in the file layout.xml
	next to the index.xml file. Early in the KPhotoAlbum 2.2
	development, it was saved in the KDE Registry, but the code for
	doing this (which is out of my control) has a bug which makes it
	impossible to save non latin1 characters.

	Thanks to Martin Hoeller for finding the three above issues.

2006-03-19  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* VERY FINAL feature: Added a checkbox to the annotation dialog
	offering to remove annotations. Thanks for Robert L Krawitz for
	patch with this feature.

	* BUGFIX: Fixed crash when annotation dialog was up, and the
	datebar got a mouse move event (It had its mouse press blocked, so
	it got quite confused from seeing a mouse move without first a
	mouse press) Thanks to Martin Hoeller for finding this crash.

	* BUGFIX: The annotation window no longer crashes when reseting
	its layout.

	* Disable the delete button in the annotation dialog when
	annotating multiple images at the same time, or when using the
	dialog for searching. Thanks to Martin Hoeller for finding this crash.

2006-03-12  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* The datebar now has an explicit button for canceling selection.

	* Fixed bug where limited images on the date bar followed by a
	limiting images from the browser, and then unlimiting from the
	browser resulted in only items in the scope of the datebar
	selection being shown on the datebar.

2006-02-11  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Drasticly improved performance of deleting images. Thanks for
	Robert L Krawitz for his analysis of the problem.

	* Don't show a warning about not being able to delete a file when
	it doesn't exists in the first place. Thanks to Robert L Krawitz.

2006-01-12  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Its now possible to select whether the newest or the oldest
	thumbnail should be shown first.

2006-01-11  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Made it possible to configure the thumbnail cache.

2006-01-02  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Completely reimplemented the thumbnail view, to solve a huge
	amount of issues with QIconView.

2005-11-27  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Added an EXIF dialog (available from the browser), plus the
	possibilities to see EXIF tags in the viewer. Set of EXIF tokens
	shown is configurable in the settings dialog.

2005-09-23  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Searches using the description field are now case insensitive.

	* Stop selecting the first image in the thumbnail view when
	showing it up.

	* BUGFIX: Setting tokens should mark the database as dirty.

	* BUGFIX: Restart slideshow timer when user manually moves to a
	new image.

2005-08-29  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Added a Exif dialog to the context menu in the browser.

	* KPhotoAlbum now stores its thumbnails in ~/.thumbnails complying
	with many other applications.

2005-08-28  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Added an option to save the index.xml file in a compressed
	format, this speeds up loading the xml file by approximate a
	factor 2.

2005-08-26  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Added command line option --export-in-2.1-format to allow
	KPhotoAlbum to save an index.xml that can be read by KPhotoAlbum 2.1. All
	configurations in the config dialog (like do auto save etc) will
	be lost though.
	
	* KPhotoAlbum does now offer to save numbered backups of the index.xml
	file: index.xml~0001~, index.xml~0002~ etc. In addition this file
	can be zipped to preserve disk space.

2005-08-19  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* recalculate checksum will now work only on the selected images
	if there is a selection.

2005-08-17  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Pressing return in the search bar now selects the current item.

2005-08-03  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Internal: Simplify ImageDate so it now is only a from and a to
	QDateTime - this makes it possible for backends to do better date
	searches (needed by the SQL backend)

	* Delay loading plugins - this will save us half a second at start
	up.

2005-07-23  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Threw away the date folder, it is redundant now we have the datebar.

	* Internal: A lot of clean up in the code has happen over the last many
	month, and I've been working on making the backend plugable, and
	implement a SQL backend. I gave up with the SQL backend, as it was
	too hard. My code is still in there in case someone wants to take
	over that part.

--------------------------- version 2.1 released --------------------------------------

2005-04-07  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: Using kapp->invokeHelp to show help rather than
	kapp->invokeBrowser, as the later doesn't work unless your default
	browser is konqueror.

	* BUGFIX: the category was sometimes shown twice in the status bar

	* BUGFIX: remove tokens didn't work for KDE 3.4

2005-04-03  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: The pre-loading in the image viewer broke viewing images
	from the import wizard.

	* BUGFIX: The import dialog was broken with new versions of Qt.

2005-03-26  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Added member group config to context menu of list select (which
	is the list boxes of the image property pages)

	* Added a jump-to-context  button to the viewer, plus ensure
	keyboard focus would be better shown in the thumbnail view.

	* BUGFIX: When quiting KDE, KPhotoAlbum will asks if you want to
	save. This previously canceled logging out of KDE.

2005-03-20  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Use KDE's date formater to given better result in the datebar.

2005-03-14  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Added a survey, where I can get some feedback from the KPhotoAlbum users.

2005-02-20  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* New images should be inserted sorted.

	* When new images are found, the datebar are now updated.

2005-01-16  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Added protection against odd sized images - like 400x1
	(Thanks	to Robert L Krawitz <rlk@alum.mit.edu>)

2005-01-13  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Fixed deadlock when generating thumbnails from the Maintenance
	menu (Thanks to Robert L Krawitz <rlk@alum.mit.edu>)

2005-01-12  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Made it possible to check if an image in the image loader was
	needed just prior to loading it - this speeds up page down in the
	thumbnail view

	* Made the settings dialog non modal, and added an apply button.

	* Finally the new thumbnail view seems to work.
	* Made it possible to configure if columns should be aligned in
	thumbnail view
	* Made it possible to configure space between columns.

2005-01-10  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Display a grey thumbnail when the image for one reason or the
	other couldn't be loaded. Previously this resulted in the
	thumbnail containing garbage pixels. 
	Thanks to Robert L Krawitz <rlk@alum.mit.edu>

2005-01-09  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Improves handling of EXIF data, in particular in the "Read EXIF
	Data" dialog.  It does not overwrite the time, date, orientation,
	or comment data unless the EXIF data is actually present.  It also
	adds two new options that do overwrite the time and date
	information with the file modification date/time if the EXIF data
	isn't present. Thanks to Robert L Krawitz <rlk@alum.mit.edu>

	* BUGFIX: The date parser was not previous translated, while the
	date generator was, thus typing in date names did not work in the
	image config dialog, unless the translated names matched the
	untranslated ones.

2005-01-08  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* The date bar now support selecting a range of images.

2005-01-02  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Reimplemented sort images as it could lead to image loss, plus
	was not guaranteed to preserve sort order for images with same key.

	* On Robert's request, removed the patch from 2004-12-08 to work
	around SUSE's max image size - due to Robert, it obviously didn't
	work.

	* Read EXIF info out of .thm files (patch from Robert L Krawitz <rlk@alum.mit.edu>)

2004-12-30  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Added the possibility to zoom out from current scope, thus
	seeing the context of the current image

	* Added Maintenance->Display Images with Incomplete Dates
	this will help update images with missing or invalid dates.

	* KPhotoAlbum no longer splits images into a bunch of folders, but
	does instead show them in one big collection, this makes the date
	bar more powerful, plus allows you to scroll backwards.

	* Added a date bar, that shows statistics about images, plus let
	you navigate to a given date.

2004-12-29  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Added a AND checkbox to the search page, that allows to
	graphically choose among and/or searches. (Thanks to Jean-Michel
	FAYARD <jmfayard@gmail.com>)

	* HTML generation didn't work if the file names contained dot's
	like 2004-12-17-18.34.59.jpg

	* Added support for Canon CRW "digital negative" - thanks to
	Steffen Hansen <hansen@kde.org>.

	* Postpone checking if images is on disk till the information is
	needed, this speeds up start up with a couple of seconds.

2004-12-20  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* KPhotoAlbum will now escape all non-latin1 characters, so they still
	look good on web servers that seems to ignore the meta tag. (Like
	mine does ;-)

2004-12-08  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Offer to make hard link from the export dialog (patch from  
	Robert L Krawitz <rlk@alum.mit.edu>)

	* SUSE introduced a maximum on QImages, a patch from  Robert L
	Krawitz <rlk@alum.mit.edu> works around this, and ensures that
	KPhotoAlbum do not crash when images are larger than the maximum size.

	* The Date picker now remember dates from invocation to invocation
	(Thanks to Jean-Michel FAYARD <jmfayard@gmail.com> for a patch for
	this)

	* Highlight date with images in the date picker. (Thanks to
	Jean-Michel FAYARD <jmfayard@gmail.com> for a patch for this)

2004-12-04  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Categories in Member Group config is now internationalized.

	* Categories in virtual album configuration (General tab in
	Settings) are now internationalized.

2004-12-02  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* In the viewer moved away every default key binding on lettered
	keys. The changes are:
	Quit: q -> escape
	Run Slideshow: s -> ctrl + r (now this is the same as from the thumbnail viewer)
	Show Infobox: i -> Ctrl + i
	Show drawings on images: d -> ctrl + d

	* In the viewer it is now possible to press a key to set a token,
	these tokens can the be used during browsing. This makes it easy
	to mark all images for say printing, by simply setting a token on
	each of them, and the later browsing for that token.

2004-11-10  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Only items from the current image are shown in the image
	category editor.

	* Added an option to automatically load images when matches in the
	browser goes below what can be shown in a single view.

2004-11-09  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Made it possible to disable searching for images on start up.

	* BUGFIX: Delayed the hide of the splash screen until the main
	window was shown.

	* Moved "show Tool Tips" to the Settings menu.

	* Added a search line.

2004-11-08  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: Markup in the editor (like highlight for spelling errors) got
	saved and thus displayed with the image.

	* Renamed the menu bar descriptions for locking, so it hopefully
	is easier to understand.

	* update progress dialog for loading info from images after each
	image, rather than after every ten images. This matters if the
	images are say 80Mb large.

--------------------------- version 2.0 released --------------------------------------
	
2004-10-16  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Items in the edit menu (among these "delete image") was
	not available if "display images not on disk" was activated from
	the browser. Thanks to Robert L Krawitz <rlk@alum.mit.edu> for
	finding the bug.

2004-09-26  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Improved date editor: (1) sizing now works (2) there are no
	default buttons, so it is possible to press enter in the line edit
	to specify a date. (3) there now is a ">>" button to copy from
	date to to-date

2004-09-22  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* The editor for image comments now has an on the fly spell checker.

	* BUGFIX: Fixed tab order in the image config dialog.

2004-09-05  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: remove splash screen before showing welcome dialog

2004-09-04  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Added a way to browse directories within the database. Thanks to
	Jean-Michel FAYARD <jmfayard@gmail.com> for patch.

	* BUGFIX: now that it is possible to set background color of
	thumbnail view, the foreground color must also be changed, to
	ensure maximum contrast (and that it is visible at all)

	* No key bindings should be made to letters in the main window, as
	this makes it impossible to press that letter in the browser to jump to
	the item in question. Thus I made these change to key bindings:
	I -> Ctrl+I (show selected images)
	Ctrl-I -> none (show selected images in new window)
	S -> ctrl+R (run slide show)
	Ctrl+S -> none (run randomized slideshow)
	          (this conflicted with save which was and are still on Ctrl-s too)
	Remember you can make your own key bindings in KPhotoAlbum, so this are
	really just the defaults I change.

2004-08-23  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Do not show items already matched when browsing. Thus do not
	show Jesper, if he is already matches in the current browsing scope.

2004-08-09  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* The viewer now preloads images, which makes it feel a LOT more
	responsive.

2004-08-08  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Added zoom out to full view in viewer.

2004-08-07  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Removed the preload hack for preview, which was broken
	anyway. Not needed now when image loading is so much faster.

2004-08-06  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Size of main windows and configuration window are now stored in
	the index.xml file, and restored for future sessions

2004-07-24  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Moved all plugins to one menu rather than scattered out over all
	the menus. The former seems like the best idea for easy finding a
	functionality, while the later seems to be best, to ensure that
	users know which functionality is KPhotoAlbum core features, and which
	are plugins, with plugins perhaps being less integrated than
	build-in features.

	* import/export is improved so during import of external images,
	KPhotoAlbum will first search for the images next to the .kim file,
	and then at the URL the images originally was uploaded to.

2004-07-22  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Made it possible to hide the labels in the thumbnail view

	* Clean up the options dialog (made new group "thumbnail view")

	* Tried to improve the layout of the thumbnail view. This is the
	best I can do, unfortunately QIconView is utterly broken.

2004-07-18  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: search dialog does now contain imported image attributes.

	* Fixed code for going into full screen (This forces the min
	version to be KDE 3.2, though)

2004-07-12  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Automatic generated labels from file names now include all up
	till the last dot (Thanks to Jean-Michel FAYARD
	<boulot.dodo@laposte.net>)

	* Fixed utf-8 encoding description in HTML pages (Thanks to
	Jean-Michel FAYARD <boulot.dodo@laposte.net>)

2004-06-17  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Put count of images in caption of image config window

2004-06-14  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Added the filename to the caption of the viewer.

	* Thanks to Marco Caldarelli <caldarel@yahoo.it> for a patch to
	reread EXIF info, available from a dialog in the menu.

2004-06-13  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Thanks to Marcel Wiesweg <marcel.wiesweg@gmx.de> for a patch for
	optimizing loading in the image property dialog

2004-06-08  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Added a splash screen

2004-06-06  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Bugfix: The time config was not set correctly for configuring
	multiple images, often resulting in many images getting the same
	time stamp.

	* Its now possible to configure which plugins should be loaded.

2004-06-03  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* demo directory are now copied rather than symlinked. With
	symlink, the installed demo files will also be modified when
	images are modified in the demo, which is not desired.

	* Added KIPI support.

2004-05-03  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: When you press cancel during the export process you still get the info
	someone else could import your export. 

	* BUGFIX: After an import the index.xml file was not marked modified

	* BUGFIX: export to HTML page and import resulted in rotated
	images getting even more rotated

	* BUGFIX: importing into a subdirectory did not always work.

2004-05-02  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: KPhotoAlbum crashed in the following situation:
	  - drag an image out from the thumbnail view
	  - browse, so the thumbnail view shows some other images
	  - drag another image out

2004-04-19  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: The wrong image was invoked in the external viewer if
	the thumbnail view was scrolled.

	* BUGFIX: If description was not generated then other option
	groups was not printed in HTML exports.

2004-04-18  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* When opening the image config dialog, show a message box with
	a link to the help page.

	* Made it possible to re enable message boxes where the user
	previously checked do-not-show-again

	* Its now possible to find images where only a set of items are on
	(e.g. only me, and no one else)

	* BUGFIX: When generating HTML, only generate image on disk

	* Added a dialog with a description on how to enable webservers to
	server KPhotoAlbum files.

2004-04-16  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: If the destination directory for HTML export exists,
	offer to remove it. This fixes the problem where it would instead
	just be put in a subdirectory.

	* Loading descriptions from EXIF information can now be disabled

	* BUGFIX: when exporting the image loader also saved the large
	images (like 1024x768) to tumbnails dir. Please remove all
	thumbnails using the maintenance menu item.

	* BUGFIX: images inline in export files was broken if the
	extension was different from .jpg

	* Now its possible to ask for a .kim file on the HTML generated pages

	* BUGFIX: pressing cancel in export dialog still continue exporting.

	* BUGFIX: It was not possible to import twice in one session.

	* BUGFIX: images was rotated too must during export

	* now its possible to export images, and leave the .kim file next
	to the image set rather than putting them into the .kim file. 

2004-04-15  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Its now possible to delete images from within the image
	configuration dialog

	* Now you may click on a .kim file from say konqueror to start
	importing that file into your db.

2004-04-14  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* added Import/Export so its possible to share images with
	friends, without them having to write comments, and tell how is on
	the images.

2004-04-12  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Its now possible to configure the toolbar

	* Added run slide show as a tool button

	* Now its possible to configure the shortcuts in the viewer.

2004-04-11  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* added run randomized slideshow

	* added run slide show to the thumbnail view, thus making it much
	easier to start a slide show if the images in view.

	* Made slide show timeout configurable

	* Made slide show size configurable, plus made it possible to
	specify full screen for configuration for configuration of normal view.

2004-03-27  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* rewrote the handling of dates in the image property dialog, so
	the GUI is much easier to work with - this must have been the
	oldest wish on my which list ;-)

2004-03-21  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Added Images->sort to sort images in thumbnail view. Thanks to
	Thomas Schwarzgruber <possebaer@gmx.at>

	* Added Maintenance->remove all thumbnails and Maintenance->build thumbnails

2004-03-20  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: now we are doing boundary check when panning, so you
	can't pan outside the image.

	* generating HTML and viewing images will now be the context if no
	images are selected. Context is the current search or current
	browse - e.g. all images from say Las Vegas.

2004-03-17  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Added context menu for sorting options listbox 
	(thanks to Reimar Imhof <Reimar.Imhof@netCologne.de> for a patch)

2004-03-10  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: Fixed crash when moving images arround

2004-03-09  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: If you have to rotate an image to view it, you get black stripes besides your 
	image because of the resolution of the image (it's much higher than wide). So 
	far so good. But if you zoom into the image via pressing '+' key, the black 
	stripes don't change -> the shown width stays the same although the 
	(virtually) height changed.
	Thanks to Thomas Schwarzgruber <possebaer@gmx.at> for a patch.

2004-03-07  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: When renaming an item in the listselect, then category
	image is now also renamed.

	* BUGFIX: In the settings dialog, member group tab, ensure that
	the category list is updated when entering the page.

	* replaced "None" with "No Persons", "No Keywords" etc.

	* the count text in the browser is now "categories" rather than
	"images" when displaying categories like "persons", "locations" etc.

	* BUGFIX: Finally made panning work. Its now bound to the middle
	mouse button, which is more compatible to a wide range of
	application, rather than Ctrl+left button as was the case
	previously.

2004-03-02  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: previous fix to member groups was broken.

	* use smoothScale rather than scale to get better looking thumbnails.

2004-02-15  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: Pressing the rename button in member groups made
	KPhotoAlbum crash if no member groups are selected.

--------------------------- version 1.1 released --------------------------------------

2004-02-04  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: description on index page was controlled by
	"description" checkbox rather than the description for each page

2004-02-01  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: categories was not available for translations.

	* BUGFIX: the string **NONE** was not made available for
	translation everywhere, which resulted in the search dialog did
	not work for translated languages.

2004-01-31  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: changed viewer from QDialog to QWidget as base class so
	the browser window could get on top of it.

2004-01-29  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Made the image preview size configurable.

	* Ensure enable/disable state of menu bar is correct

2004-01-27  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Made the KPhotoAlbum properties dialog look better.

2004-01-26  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	error when the viewer closes.

	* BUGFIX: Fixed bug introduced yesterday, where rotating multiple
	images resulting in them getting an odd angle.

2004-01-25  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	to specify which of the category (Persons/Location/...) plus
	description - to generate.

	* The image configuration dialog may now be closed by pressing Ctrl+return

	* Added a number of tooltips

	* Added a donate dialog, which makes it possible for people to
	donate money.

	* BUGFIX: when generating HTML, its no longer a problem if several
	images have the same base name, ie. if you may now generate
	holiday1/me.jpg andd holiday2/me.jpg at the same time.

	* BUGFIX: When the user presses the right mouse button on one of
	the list boxes containing options (Persons, Loactions, Events
	etc.) to show the context menu, then the state of the item was
	changed (from selected to non-selected or visa versa).

	* The total amount of images in the status bar is now updated when
	new images are found or existing images are deleted.

	* BUGFIX: don't load the search and multi-config images through
	the imageinfo clas as this will make KPhotoAlbum ask whether date
	should be trusted.

	* Added a configuration option for whether EXIF rotation
	information should be used or not.

2004-01-23  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: It was not possible to generate HTML more than once per session.

	* Read date, orientation and description out of EXIF data.

2004-01-21  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Thanks to Teemu Rytilahti <teemu.rytilahti@kde-fi.org>, KPhotoAlbum
	will now offer themes when generating HTML.

	* Heavily optimized browsing functions. Now everything is
	hopefully lightning fast.

2004-01-20  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* The thumbnail overview and the image viewer now has a menu item
	for invoking an external program on the images. The list includes
	all programs claiming they can handle image/jpeg from KTrader.

	* Implemented Maintenance/Display Images not on Disk

	* Implemented Maintenance/Recalculate Checksum (Useful if images
	has been change for example using gimp)

	* Implemented Maintenance/Rescan for new Images

	* Only do auto save if there has been changes since the last auto save.

2004-01-19  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* MD5 sums are now calculated for each image, so that KPhotoAlbum can
	track movement of images in the directories

2004-01-18  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Move cursor to the lower right corner when viewer goes into fullscreen mode

	* BUGFIX: Generate HTML with nothing selected now export all
	images from thumbnail view.

	* BUGFIX: Context menu for thumbnail view used to show up in the
	browser too.

	* BUGFIX: searches using the textbox didn't work.

	* BUGFIX: ensure that tip of the day has focus when it starts up.

2004-01-10  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Improved HTML generation.

2004-01-04  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* The tool tip for the thumbnail view now contains an enlargement
	of the image. In addition the tool tip needs to be disabled,
	rather than it automatically hides. The tool tip window will
	temporarily hide when the mouse is outside the thumbnail view.
	The placement of the tool tip window is now improved, so it
	doesn't get partly of screen.

2004-01-03  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Added an item to the context menu in the viewer for setting the
	current image as the background. (Thanks to Teemu Rytilahti
	<teemu.rytilahti@kde-fi.org>) for a patch with this feature.

	* New Feature: It is now possible to show the content views (those
	with overview of persons, locations, keywords etc) either with a
	list view or with an icon view. In addition it is also possible to
	show a different icon for each item (one icon for Joe, and another
	for Bill).

2003-12-30  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: Member groups are not shown in the browser, in case the
	member group do not contain any items.

2003-12-26  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Update thumnail view when an image has been rotated.

	* Added "View Selected" and "View Selected in new window" to the
	context menu for the thumbnail overview.

	* Enable/Disable state of "configure property items" are now correctly set.

	* On public demand, the file name is now shown in the status bar.

2003-12-13  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: fixed crash where KPhotoAlbum crashes if you right click outside
	an item in one of the list boxes with properties (Persons,
	Locations, ...)

2003-12-05  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: KPhotoAlbum used to crash on moving images around.

2003-12-01  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* New Feature: Its now possible to drag(copy) images from kphotoalbum
	to say the desktop. Unfortunately KPhotoAlbum crashes in KDE code if I
	drag an QImage out, so I can only drag the filename out, which
	means that rotated images are not rotated when dragged out. Still
	better than nothing ;-)


	* Go out of full screen if an item from the info box in the viewer
	is selected, and the viewer is on the same monitor as the browser.

	* Added Settings | Configure Shortcuts

	* Edit->Options was moved Settings->Configure Kphotoalbum.

	* New Feature: It is now possible to using fish:// or ftp:// when
	exporting to HTML

	* BUGFIX: Don't show HTML export dialog in case no item was selected.

---------------------------------- version 1.0 released --------------------
2003-11-27  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: Previously the image loader was asked to load all images
	on start up, making machines with low memory crash. This was
	clearly unintentional, and as such a bug.

2003-11-21  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: indicator marks are now properly shown during selection
	of drawing on images.

2003-11-13  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: File names did not contain an extension in the ThumbNail
	directory. This resulted in a name class if two files existed with
	same base name but different extension.

	* Completed the KPhotoAlbum handbook.

	* BUGFIX: KPhotoAlbum did always show one image less than the index promised.

	* IMPROVEMENT: Exchanged Ctrl+plus and Ctrl+minus in the viewer, so ctrl+plus
	now means run faster and ctrl+minus means run slower. This seems
	much more intuitive.

2003-10-21  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: First search for an image, then set properties, and the
	app crashed.

2003-10-05  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: KPhotoAlbum crashed when it found new images at start up.

	* Started writing a handbook for KPhotoAlbum.

	* BUGFIX: if the slideshow was running very fast, then keyevents got utterly much
	  behind making it almost impossible to stop the slideshow.

	* Its now possible to configure image properties from within the viewer.

2003-10-04  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Added new feature, which allows you to specify a default search
	option, that applies to all searches. That way you can exclude all
	private images, when looking at images with say, your parents.

	* BUGFIX: If a user added a new group, but never added any items
	to the group, then the group would not be available later for
	adding new items, but it was still available for selecting in
	configuration listbox and for searching.

	* BUGFIX: When a group was renamed or delete, the old name would still be
	available in the configuration listbox.

	* Added status bar icon for dirtyness.

	* BUGFIX: In the image config, selecting an item from the listbox
	did not mark the image dirty.

	* BUGFIX: Pressing Cancel in the find dialog, does no longer
	change the content of the browser window.
