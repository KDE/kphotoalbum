=========================== KPhotoAlbum 2.2 released =============================
	
2006-04-14  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: Fixed some problems with member groups, when renaming categories.

2006-03-31  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX:Disallow pressing pgdown/pgup in the annotation dialog
	when searching. Thanks to Martin Hoeller for finding this crash.

2006-03-26  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Bugfix: inaccurate times now survives a visit to the annotation dialog.

	* Bugfix: Member maps wasn't correctly renamed when renaming a category.

	* Save the layout of the annotation dialog in the file layout.xml
	next to the index.xml file. Early in the KPhotoAlbum 2.2
	development, it was saved in the KDE Registry, but the code for
	doing this (which is out of my control) has a bug which makes it
	impossible to save non latin1 characters.

	Thanks to Martin Hoeller for finding the three above issues.

2006-03-19  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* VERY FINAL feature: Added a checkbox to the annotation dialog
	offering to remove annotations. Thanks for Robert L Krawitz for
	patch with this feature.

	* BUGFIX: Fixed crash when annotation dialog was up, and the
	datebar got a mouse move event (It had its mouse press blocked, so
	it got quite confused from seeing a mouse move without first a
	mouse press) Thanks to Martin Hoeller for finding this crash.

	* BUGFIX: The annotation window no longer crashes when reseting
	its layout.

	* Disable the delete button in the annotation dialog when
	annotating multiple images at the same time, or when using the
	dialog for searching. Thanks to Martin Hoeller for finding this crash.

2006-03-12  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* The datebar now has an explicit button for canceling selection.

	* Fixed bug where limited images on the date bar followed by a
	limiting images from the browser, and then unlimiting from the
	browser resulted in only items in the scope of the datebar
	selection being shown on the datebar.

2006-02-11  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Drasticly improved performance of deleting images. Thanks for
	Robert L Krawitz for his analysis of the problem.

	* Don't show a warning about not being able to delete a file when
	it doesn't exists in the first place. Thanks to Robert L Krawitz.

2006-01-12  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Its now possible to select whether the newest or the oldest
	thumbnail should be shown first.

2006-01-11  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Made it possible to configure the thumbnail cache.

2006-01-02  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Completely reimplemented the thumbnail view, to solve a huge
	amount of issues with QIconView.

2005-11-27  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Added an EXIF dialog (available from the browser), plus the
	possibilities to see EXIF tags in the viewer. Set of EXIF tokens
	shown is configurable in the settings dialog.

2005-09-23  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Searches using the description field are now case insensitive.

	* Stop selecting the first image in the thumbnail view when
	showing it up.

	* BUGFIX: Setting tokens should mark the database as dirty.

	* BUGFIX: Restart slideshow timer when user manually moves to a
	new image.

2005-08-29  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Added a Exif dialog to the context menu in the browser.

	* KPhotoAlbum now stores its thumbnails in ~/.thumbnails complying
	with many other applications.

2005-08-28  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Added an option to save the index.xml file in a compressed
	format, this speeds up loading the xml file by approximate a
	factor 2.

2005-08-26  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Added command line option --export-in-2.1-format to allow
	KPhotoAlbum to save an index.xml that can be read by KPhotoAlbum 2.1. All
	configurations in the config dialog (like do auto save etc) will
	be lost though.
	
	* KPhotoAlbum does now offer to save numbered backups of the index.xml
	file: index.xml~0001~, index.xml~0002~ etc. In addition this file
	can be zipped to preserve disk space.

2005-08-19  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* recalculate checksum will now work only on the selected images
	if there is a selection.

2005-08-17  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Pressing return in the search bar now selects the current item.

2005-08-03  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Internal: Simplify ImageDate so it now is only a from and a to
	QDateTime - this makes it possible for backends to do better date
	searches (needed by the SQL backend)

	* Delay loading plugins - this will save us half a second at start
	up.

2005-07-23  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Threw away the date folder, it is redundant now we have the datebar.

	* Internal: A lot of clean up in the code has happen over the last many
	month, and I've been working on making the backend plugable, and
	implement a SQL backend. I gave up with the SQL backend, as it was
	too hard. My code is still in there in case someone wants to take
	over that part.

--------------------------- version 2.1 released --------------------------------------

2005-04-07  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: Using kapp->invokeHelp to show help rather than
	kapp->invokeBrowser, as the later doesn't work unless your default
	browser is konqueror.

	* BUGFIX: the category was sometimes shown twice in the status bar

	* BUGFIX: remove tokens didn't work for KDE 3.4

2005-04-03  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: The pre-loading in the image viewer broke viewing images
	from the import wizard.

	* BUGFIX: The import dialog was broken with new versions of Qt.

2005-03-26  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Added member group config to context menu of list select (which
	is the list boxes of the image property pages)

	* Added a jump-to-context  button to the viewer, plus ensure
	keyboard focus would be better shown in the thumbnail view.

	* BUGFIX: When quiting KDE, KPhotoAlbum will asks if you want to
	save. This previously canceled logging out of KDE.

2005-03-20  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Use KDE's date formater to given better result in the datebar.

2005-03-14  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Added a survey, where I can get some feedback from the KPhotoAlbum users.

2005-02-20  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* New images should be inserted sorted.

	* When new images are found, the datebar are now updated.

2005-01-16  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Added protection against odd sized images - like 400x1
	(Thanks	to Robert L Krawitz <rlk@alum.mit.edu>)

2005-01-13  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Fixed deadlock when generating thumbnails from the Maintenance
	menu (Thanks to Robert L Krawitz <rlk@alum.mit.edu>)

2005-01-12  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Made it possible to check if an image in the image loader was
	needed just prior to loading it - this speeds up page down in the
	thumbnail view

	* Made the settings dialog non modal, and added an apply button.

	* Finally the new thumbnail view seems to work.
	* Made it possible to configure if columns should be aligned in
	thumbnail view
	* Made it possible to configure space between columns.

2005-01-10  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Display a grey thumbnail when the image for one reason or the
	other couldn't be loaded. Previously this resulted in the
	thumbnail containing garbage pixels. 
	Thanks to Robert L Krawitz <rlk@alum.mit.edu>

2005-01-09  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Improves handling of EXIF data, in particular in the "Read EXIF
	Data" dialog.  It does not overwrite the time, date, orientation,
	or comment data unless the EXIF data is actually present.  It also
	adds two new options that do overwrite the time and date
	information with the file modification date/time if the EXIF data
	isn't present. Thanks to Robert L Krawitz <rlk@alum.mit.edu>

	* BUGFIX: The date parser was not previous translated, while the
	date generator was, thus typing in date names did not work in the
	image config dialog, unless the translated names matched the
	untranslated ones.

2005-01-08  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* The date bar now support selecting a range of images.

2005-01-02  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Reimplemented sort images as it could lead to image loss, plus
	was not guaranteed to preserve sort order for images with same key.

	* On Robert's request, removed the patch from 2004-12-08 to work
	around SUSE's max image size - due to Robert, it obviously didn't
	work.

	* Read EXIF info out of .thm files (patch from Robert L Krawitz <rlk@alum.mit.edu>)

2004-12-30  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Added the possibility to zoom out from current scope, thus
	seeing the context of the current image

	* Added Maintenance->Display Images with Incomplete Dates
	this will help update images with missing or invalid dates.

	* KPhotoAlbum no longer splits images into a bunch of folders, but
	does instead show them in one big collection, this makes the date
	bar more powerful, plus allows you to scroll backwards.

	* Added a date bar, that shows statistics about images, plus let
	you navigate to a given date.

2004-12-29  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Added a AND checkbox to the search page, that allows to
	graphically choose among and/or searches. (Thanks to Jean-Michel
	FAYARD <jmfayard@gmail.com>)

	* HTML generation didn't work if the file names contained dot's
	like 2004-12-17-18.34.59.jpg

	* Added support for Canon CRW "digital negative" - thanks to
	Steffen Hansen <hansen@kde.org>.

	* Postpone checking if images is on disk till the information is
	needed, this speeds up start up with a couple of seconds.

2004-12-20  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* KPhotoAlbum will now escape all non-latin1 characters, so they still
	look good on web servers that seems to ignore the meta tag. (Like
	mine does ;-)

2004-12-08  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Offer to make hard link from the export dialog (patch from  
	Robert L Krawitz <rlk@alum.mit.edu>)

	* SUSE introduced a maximum on QImages, a patch from  Robert L
	Krawitz <rlk@alum.mit.edu> works around this, and ensures that
	KPhotoAlbum do not crash when images are larger than the maximum size.

	* The Date picker now remember dates from invocation to invocation
	(Thanks to Jean-Michel FAYARD <jmfayard@gmail.com> for a patch for
	this)

	* Highlight date with images in the date picker. (Thanks to
	Jean-Michel FAYARD <jmfayard@gmail.com> for a patch for this)

2004-12-04  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Categories in Member Group config is now internationalized.

	* Categories in virtual album configuration (General tab in
	Settings) are now internationalized.

2004-12-02  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* In the viewer moved away every default key binding on lettered
	keys. The changes are:
	Quit: q -> escape
	Run Slideshow: s -> ctrl + r (now this is the same as from the thumbnail viewer)
	Show Infobox: i -> Ctrl + i
	Show drawings on images: d -> ctrl + d

	* In the viewer it is now possible to press a key to set a token,
	these tokens can the be used during browsing. This makes it easy
	to mark all images for say printing, by simply setting a token on
	each of them, and the later browsing for that token.

2004-11-10  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Only items from the current image are shown in the image
	category editor.

	* Added an option to automatically load images when matches in the
	browser goes below what can be shown in a single view.

2004-11-09  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Made it possible to disable searching for images on start up.

	* BUGFIX: Delayed the hide of the splash screen until the main
	window was shown.

	* Moved "show Tool Tips" to the Settings menu.

	* Added a search line.

2004-11-08  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: Markup in the editor (like highlight for spelling errors) got
	saved and thus displayed with the image.

	* Renamed the menu bar descriptions for locking, so it hopefully
	is easier to understand.

	* update progress dialog for loading info from images after each
	image, rather than after every ten images. This matters if the
	images are say 80Mb large.

--------------------------- version 2.0 released --------------------------------------
	
2004-10-16  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Items in the edit menu (among these "delete image") was
	not available if "display images not on disk" was activated from
	the browser. Thanks to Robert L Krawitz <rlk@alum.mit.edu> for
	finding the bug.

2004-09-26  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Improved date editor: (1) sizing now works (2) there are no
	default buttons, so it is possible to press enter in the line edit
	to specify a date. (3) there now is a ">>" button to copy from
	date to to-date

2004-09-22  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* The editor for image comments now has an on the fly spell checker.

	* BUGFIX: Fixed tab order in the image config dialog.

2004-09-05  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: remove splash screen before showing welcome dialog

2004-09-04  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Added a way to browse directories within the database. Thanks to
	Jean-Michel FAYARD <jmfayard@gmail.com> for patch.

	* BUGFIX: now that it is possible to set background color of
	thumbnail view, the foreground color must also be changed, to
	ensure maximum contrast (and that it is visible at all)

	* No key bindings should be made to letters in the main window, as
	this makes it impossible to press that letter in the browser to jump to
	the item in question. Thus I made these change to key bindings:
	I -> Ctrl+I (show selected images)
	Ctrl-I -> none (show selected images in new window)
	S -> ctrl+R (run slide show)
	Ctrl+S -> none (run randomized slideshow)
	          (this conflicted with save which was and are still on Ctrl-s too)
	Remember you can make your own key bindings in KPhotoAlbum, so this are
	really just the defaults I change.

2004-08-23  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Do not show items already matched when browsing. Thus do not
	show Jesper, if he is already matches in the current browsing scope.

2004-08-09  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* The viewer now preloads images, which makes it feel a LOT more
	responsive.

2004-08-08  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Added zoom out to full view in viewer.

2004-08-07  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Removed the preload hack for preview, which was broken
	anyway. Not needed now when image loading is so much faster.

2004-08-06  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Size of main windows and configuration window are now stored in
	the index.xml file, and restored for future sessions

2004-07-24  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Moved all plugins to one menu rather than scattered out over all
	the menus. The former seems like the best idea for easy finding a
	functionality, while the later seems to be best, to ensure that
	users know which functionality is KPhotoAlbum core features, and which
	are plugins, with plugins perhaps being less integrated than
	build-in features.

	* import/export is improved so during import of external images,
	KPhotoAlbum will first search for the images next to the .kim file,
	and then at the URL the images originally was uploaded to.

2004-07-22  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Made it possible to hide the labels in the thumbnail view

	* Clean up the options dialog (made new group "thumbnail view")

	* Tried to improve the layout of the thumbnail view. This is the
	best I can do, unfortunately QIconView is utterly broken.

2004-07-18  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: search dialog does now contain imported image attributes.

	* Fixed code for going into full screen (This forces the min
	version to be KDE 3.2, though)

2004-07-12  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Automatic generated labels from file names now include all up
	till the last dot (Thanks to Jean-Michel FAYARD
	<boulot.dodo@laposte.net>)

	* Fixed utf-8 encoding description in HTML pages (Thanks to
	Jean-Michel FAYARD <boulot.dodo@laposte.net>)

2004-06-17  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Put count of images in caption of image config window

2004-06-14  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Added the filename to the caption of the viewer.

	* Thanks to Marco Caldarelli <caldarel@yahoo.it> for a patch to
	reread EXIF info, available from a dialog in the menu.

2004-06-13  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Thanks to Marcel Wiesweg <marcel.wiesweg@gmx.de> for a patch for
	optimizing loading in the image property dialog

2004-06-08  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Added a splash screen

2004-06-06  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Bugfix: The time config was not set correctly for configuring
	multiple images, often resulting in many images getting the same
	time stamp.

	* Its now possible to configure which plugins should be loaded.

2004-06-03  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* demo directory are now copied rather than symlinked. With
	symlink, the installed demo files will also be modified when
	images are modified in the demo, which is not desired.

	* Added KIPI support.

2004-05-03  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: When you press cancel during the export process you still get the info
	someone else could import your export. 

	* BUGFIX: After an import the index.xml file was not marked modified

	* BUGFIX: export to HTML page and import resulted in rotated
	images getting even more rotated

	* BUGFIX: importing into a subdirectory did not always work.

2004-05-02  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: KPhotoAlbum crashed in the following situation:
	  - drag an image out from the thumbnail view
	  - browse, so the thumbnail view shows some other images
	  - drag another image out

2004-04-19  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: The wrong image was invoked in the external viewer if
	the thumbnail view was scrolled.

	* BUGFIX: If description was not generated then other option
	groups was not printed in HTML exports.

2004-04-18  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* When opening the image config dialog, show a message box with
	a link to the help page.

	* Made it possible to re enable message boxes where the user
	previously checked do-not-show-again

	* Its now possible to find images where only a set of items are on
	(e.g. only me, and no one else)

	* BUGFIX: When generating HTML, only generate image on disk

	* Added a dialog with a description on how to enable webservers to
	server KPhotoAlbum files.

2004-04-16  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: If the destination directory for HTML export exists,
	offer to remove it. This fixes the problem where it would instead
	just be put in a subdirectory.

	* Loading descriptions from EXIF information can now be disabled

	* BUGFIX: when exporting the image loader also saved the large
	images (like 1024x768) to tumbnails dir. Please remove all
	thumbnails using the maintenance menu item.

	* BUGFIX: images inline in export files was broken if the
	extension was different from .jpg

	* Now its possible to ask for a .kim file on the HTML generated pages

	* BUGFIX: pressing cancel in export dialog still continue exporting.

	* BUGFIX: It was not possible to import twice in one session.

	* BUGFIX: images was rotated too must during export

	* now its possible to export images, and leave the .kim file next
	to the image set rather than putting them into the .kim file. 

2004-04-15  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Its now possible to delete images from within the image
	configuration dialog

	* Now you may click on a .kim file from say konqueror to start
	importing that file into your db.

2004-04-14  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* added Import/Export so its possible to share images with
	friends, without them having to write comments, and tell how is on
	the images.

2004-04-12  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Its now possible to configure the toolbar

	* Added run slide show as a tool button

	* Now its possible to configure the shortcuts in the viewer.

2004-04-11  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* added run randomized slideshow

	* added run slide show to the thumbnail view, thus making it much
	easier to start a slide show if the images in view.

	* Made slide show timeout configurable

	* Made slide show size configurable, plus made it possible to
	specify full screen for configuration for configuration of normal view.

2004-03-27  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* rewrote the handling of dates in the image property dialog, so
	the GUI is much easier to work with - this must have been the
	oldest wish on my which list ;-)

2004-03-21  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Added Images->sort to sort images in thumbnail view. Thanks to
	Thomas Schwarzgruber <possebaer@gmx.at>

	* Added Maintenance->remove all thumbnails and Maintenance->build thumbnails

2004-03-20  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: now we are doing boundary check when panning, so you
	can't pan outside the image.

	* generating HTML and viewing images will now be the context if no
	images are selected. Context is the current search or current
	browse - e.g. all images from say Las Vegas.

2004-03-17  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Added context menu for sorting options listbox 
	(thanks to Reimar Imhof <Reimar.Imhof@netCologne.de> for a patch)

2004-03-10  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: Fixed crash when moving images arround

2004-03-09  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: If you have to rotate an image to view it, you get black stripes besides your 
	image because of the resolution of the image (it's much higher than wide). So 
	far so good. But if you zoom into the image via pressing '+' key, the black 
	stripes don't change -> the shown width stays the same although the 
	(virtually) height changed.
	Thanks to Thomas Schwarzgruber <possebaer@gmx.at> for a patch.

2004-03-07  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	image is now also renamed.

	* BUGFIX: In the settings dialog, member group tab, ensure that
	the category list is updated when entering the page.

	* the count text in the browser is now "categories" rather than
	"images" when displaying categories like "persons", "locations" etc.

	mouse button, which is more compatible to a wide range of
	application, rather than Ctrl+left button as was the case
	previously.

	KPhotoAlbum crash if no member groups are selected.

2004-02-04  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: description on index page was controlled by
	"description" checkbox rather than the description for each page

2004-02-01  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: categories was not available for translations.

	* BUGFIX: the string **NONE** was not made available for
	translation everywhere, which resulted in the search dialog did
	not work for translated languages.

2004-01-31  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: changed viewer from QDialog to QWidget as base class so
	the browser window could get on top of it.

	* The image configuration dialog may now be closed by pressing Ctrl+return

	* Added a number of tooltips

	* Added a donate dialog, which makes it possible for people to
	donate money.

	* BUGFIX: when generating HTML, its no longer a problem if several
	images have the same base name, ie. if you may now generate
	holiday1/me.jpg andd holiday2/me.jpg at the same time.

	* BUGFIX: When the user presses the right mouse button on one of
	the list boxes containing options (Persons, Loactions, Keywords
	etc.) to show the context menu, then the state of the item was
	changed (from selected to non-selected or visa versa).

	* The total amount of images in the status bar is now updated when
	new images are found or existing images are deleted.

	* BUGFIX: don't load the search and multi-config images through
	the imageinfo clas as this will make KPhotoAlbum ask whether date
	should be trusted.

	* Added a configuration option for whether EXIF rotation
	information should be used or not.

2004-01-23  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	for invoking an external program on the images. The list includes
	all programs claiming they can handle image/jpeg from KTrader.

	* Implemented Maintenance/Display Images not on Disk

	* Implemented Maintenance/Recalculate Checksum (Useful if images
	has been change for example using gimp)

	* Implemented Maintenance/Rescan for new Images

	* Only do auto save if there has been changes since the last auto save.

2004-01-19  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* MD5 sums are now calculated for each image, so that KPhotoAlbum can
	track movement of images in the directories

2004-01-04  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* The tool tip for the thumbnail view now contains an enlargement
	of the image. In addition the tool tip needs to be disabled,
	rather than it automatically hides. The tool tip window will
	temporarily hide when the mouse is outside the thumbnail view.
	The placement of the tool tip window is now improved, so it
	doesn't get partly of screen.

2004-01-03  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Added an item to the context menu in the viewer for setting the
	current image as the background. (Thanks to Teemu Rytilahti
	<teemu.rytilahti@kde-fi.org>) for a patch with this feature.

	* New Feature: It is now possible to show the content views (those
	with overview of persons, locations, keywords etc) either with a
	list view or with an icon view. In addition it is also possible to
	show a different icon for each item (one icon for Joe, and another
	for Bill).

2003-12-30  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: Member groups are not shown in the browser, in case the
	member group do not contain any items.

	an item in one of the list boxes with properties (Persons,
	Locations, ...)

2003-12-05  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: KPhotoAlbum used to crash on moving images around.

2003-12-01  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* New Feature: Its now possible to drag(copy) images from kphotoalbum
	to say the desktop. Unfortunately KPhotoAlbum crashes in KDE code if I
	drag an QImage out, so I can only drag the filename out, which
	means that rotated images are not rotated when dragged out. Still
	better than nothing ;-)


	* Go out of full screen if an item from the info box in the viewer
	is selected, and the viewer is on the same monitor as the browser.

	* Added Settings | Configure Shortcuts

	* Edit->Options was moved Settings->Configure Kphotoalbum.

---------------------------------- version 1.0 released --------------------
2003-11-27  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: Previously the image loader was asked to load all images
	on start up, making machines with low memory crash. This was
	clearly unintentional, and as such a bug.

2003-11-21  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: indicator marks are now properly shown during selection
	of drawing on images.

2003-11-13  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: File names did not contain an extension in the ThumbNail
	directory. This resulted in a name class if two files existed with
	same base name but different extension.

	* Completed the KPhotoAlbum handbook.

	* BUGFIX: KPhotoAlbum did always show one image less than the index promised.

	* IMPROVEMENT: Exchanged Ctrl+plus and Ctrl+minus in the viewer, so ctrl+plus
	now means run faster and ctrl+minus means run slower. This seems
	much more intuitive.

2003-10-21  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: First search for an image, then set properties, and the
	app crashed.

2003-10-05  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: KPhotoAlbum crashed when it found new images at start up.

	* Started writing a handbook for KPhotoAlbum.

	* BUGFIX: if the slideshow was running very fast, then keyevents got utterly much
	  behind making it almost impossible to stop the slideshow.

	* Its now possible to configure image properties from within the viewer.

2003-10-04  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Added new feature, which allows you to specify a default search
	option, that applies to all searches. That way you can exclude all
	private images, when looking at images with say, your parents.

	* BUGFIX: If a user added a new group, but never added any items
	to the group, then the group would not be available later for
	adding new items, but it was still available for selecting in
	configuration listbox and for searching.

	* BUGFIX: When a group was renamed or delete, the old name would still be
	available in the configuration listbox.

	* Added status bar icon for dirtyness.

	* BUGFIX: In the image config, selecting an item from the listbox
	did not mark the image dirty.

	* BUGFIX: Pressing Cancel in the find dialog, does no longer
	change the content of the browser window.
