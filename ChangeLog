	* added Import/Export so its possible to share images with
	friends, without them having to write comments, and tell how is on
	the images.

2004-04-12  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Added run slide show as a tool button

	* Now its possible to configure the shortcuts in the viewer.

2004-04-11  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	easier to start a slide show if the images in view.

	* Made slide show timeout configurable

	* Made slide show size configurable, plus made it possible to
	specify full screen for configuration for configuration of normal view.

2004-03-27  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* rewrote the handling of dates in the image property dialog, so
	the GUI is must easier to work with - this must have been the
	oldest wish on my which list ;-)

2004-03-21  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Added Images->sort to sort images in thumbnail view. Thanks to
	Thomas Schwarzgruber <possebaer@gmx.at>

	* Added Maintenance->remove all thumbnails and Maintenance->build thumbnails

2004-03-20  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: now we are doing boundary check when panning, so you
	can't pan outside the image.

	* generating HTML and viewing images will now be the context if no
	images are selected. Context is the current search or current
	browse - e.g. all images from say Las Vegas.

2004-03-17  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Added context menu for sorting options listbox 
	(thanks to Reimar Imhof <Reimar.Imhof@netCologne.de> for a patch)

2004-03-10  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: Fixed crash when moving images arround

2004-03-09  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: If you have to rotate an image to view it, you get black stripes besides your 
	image because of the resolution of the image (it's much higher than wide). So 
	far so good. But if you zoom into the image via pressing '+' key, the black 
	stripes don't change -> the shown width stays the same although the 
	(virtually) height changed.
	Thanks to Thomas Schwarzgruber <possebaer@gmx.at> for a patch.

2004-03-07  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: When renaming an item in the listselect, then category
	image is now also renamed.

	* BUGFIX: In the settings dialog, member group tab, ensure that
	the category list is updated when entering the page.

	* replaced "None" with "No Persons", "No Keywords" etc.

	* the count text in the browser is now "categories" rather than
	"images" when displaying categories like "persons", "locations" etc.

	* BUGFIX: Finally made panning work. Its now bound to the middle
	mouse button, which is more compatible to a wide range of
	application, rather than Ctrl+left button as was the case
	previously.

2004-03-02  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: previous fix to member groups was broken.

	* BUGFIX: Pressing the rename button in member groups made
	KimDaBa crash if no member groups are selected.

--------------------------- version 1.1 released --------------------------------------

2004-02-04  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: description on index page was controlled by
	"description" checkbox rather than the description for each page

2004-02-01  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: option groups was not available for translations.

	* BUGFIX: the string **NONE** was not made available for
	translation everywhere, which resulted in the search dialog did
	not work for translated languages.

2004-01-31  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: changed viewer from QDialog to QWidget as base class so
	the browser window could get on top of it.

	description - to generate.

	* The image configuration dialog may now be closed by pressing Ctrl+return

	* Added a number of tooltips

	* Added a donate dialog, which makes it possible for people to
	donate money.

	* BUGFIX: when generating HTML, its no longer a problem if several
	images have the same base name, ie. if you may now generate
	holiday1/me.jpg andd holiday2/me.jpg at the same time.

	* BUGFIX: When the user presses the right mouse button on one of
	the list boxes containing options (Persons, Loactions, Keywords
	etc.) to show the context menu, then the state of the item was
	changed (from selected to non-selected or visa versa).

	* The total amount of images in the status bar is now updated when
	new images are found or existing images are deleted.

	* BUGFIX: don't load the search and multi-config images through
	the imageinfo clas as this will make KimDaBa ask whether date
	should be trusted.

	* Added a configuration option for whether EXIF rotation
	information should be used or not.

2004-01-23  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

2004-01-21  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	hopefully lightning fast.

	for invoking an external program on the images. The list includes
	all programs claiming they can handle image/jpeg from KTrader.

	* Implemented Maintenance/Display Images not on Disk

	* Implemented Maintenance/Recalculate Checksum (Useful if images
	has been change for example using gimp)

	* Implemented Maintenance/Rescan for new Images

	* Only do auto save if there has been changes since the last auto save.

2004-01-19  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* MD5 sums are now calculated for each image, so that KimDaBa can
	track movement of images in the directories

2004-01-04  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* The tool tip for the thumbnail view now contains an enlargement
	of the image. In addition the tool tip needs to be disabled,
	rather than it automatically hides. The tool tip window will
	temporarily hide when the mouse is outside the thumbnail view.
	The placement of the tool tip window is now improved, so it
	doesn't get partly of screen.

2004-01-03  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Added an item to the context menu in the viewer for setting the
	current image as the background. (Thanks to Teemu Rytilahti
	<teemu.rytilahti@kde-fi.org>) for a patch with this feature.

	* New Feature: It is now possible to show the content views (those
	with overview of persons, locations, keywords etc) either with a
	list view or with an icon view. In addition it is also possible to
	show a different icon for each item (one icon for Joe, and another
	for Bill).

2003-12-30  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: Member groups are not shown in the browser, in case the
	member group do not contain any items.

2003-12-26  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	an item in one of the list boxes with properties (Persons,
	Locations, ...)

2003-12-05  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: KimDaBa used to crash on moving images around.

2003-12-01  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* New Feature: Its now possible to drag(copy) images from kimdaba
	to say the desktop. Unfortunately KimDaBa crashes in KDE code if I
	drag an QImage out, so I can only drag the filename out, which
	means that rotated images are not rotated when dragged out. Still
	better than nothing ;-)


	* Go out of full screen if an item from the info box in the viewer
	is selected, and the viewer is on the same monitor as the browser.

	* Added Settings | Configure Shortcuts

	* Edit->Options was moved Settings->Configure Kimdaba.

	exporting to HTML

---------------------------------- version 1.0 released --------------------
2003-11-27  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: Previously the image loader was asked to load all images
	on start up, making machines with low memory crash. This was
	clearly unintentional, and as such a bug.

2003-11-21  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: indicator marks are now properly shown during selection
	of drawing on images.

2003-11-13  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: File names did not contain an extension in the ThumbNail
	directory. This resulted in a name class if two files existed with
	same base name but different extension.

	* Completed the KimDaBa handbook.

	* BUGFIX: KimDaBa did always show one image less than the index promised.

	* IMPROVEMENT: Exchanged Ctrl+plus and Ctrl+minus in the viewer, so ctrl+plus
	now means run faster and ctrl+minus means run slower. This seems
	much more intuitive.

2003-10-21  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: First search for an image, then set properties, and the
	app crashed.

2003-10-05  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: KimDaBa crashed when it found new images at start up.

	* Started writing a handbook for KimDaBa.

	* BUGFIX: if the slideshow was running very fast, then keyevents got utterly much
	  behind making it almost impossible to stop the slideshow.

	* Its now possible to configure image properties from within the viewer.

2003-10-04  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Added new feature, which allows you to specify a default search
	option, that applies to all searches. That way you can exclude all
	private images, when looking at images with say, your parents.

	* BUGFIX: If a user added a new group, but never added any items
	to the group, then the group would not be available later for
	adding new items, but it was still available for selecting in
	configuration listbox and for searching.

	* BUGFIX: When a group was renamed or delete, the old name would still be
	available in the configuration listbox.

	* Added status bar icon for dirtyness.

	* BUGFIX: In the image config, selecting an item from the listbox
	did not mark the image dirty.

	* BUGFIX: Pressing Cancel in the find dialog, does no longer
	change the content of the browser window.
