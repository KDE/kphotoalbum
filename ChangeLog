	* BUGFIX: KimDaBa crashed when it found new images at start up.

	* Started writing a handbook for KimDaBa.

	* BUGFIX: if the slideshow was running very fast, then keyevents got utterly much
	  behind making it almost impossible to stop the slideshow.

	* Its now possible to configure image properties from within the viewer.

	* Added new feature, which allows you to specify a default search
	option, that applies to all searches. That way you can exclude all
	private images, when looking at images with say, your parents.

	* BUGFIX: If a user added a new group, but never added any items
	to the group, then the group would not be available later for
	adding new items, but it was still available for selecting in
	configuration listbox and for searching.

	* BUGFIX: When a group was renamed or delete, the old name would still be
	available in the configuration listbox.

	* Added status bar icon for dirtyness.

	* BUGFIX: In the image config, selecting an item from the listbox
	did not mark the image dirty.

	* BUGFIX: Pressing Cancel in the find dialog, does no longer
	change the content of the browser window.
