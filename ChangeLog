2004-01-26  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: Changed QActions to KActions in the viewer to avoid mem
	error when the viewer closes.

	images resulting in them getting an odd angle.

2004-01-25  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	to specify which of the option groups (Persons/Location/...) plus
	description - to generate.

	* The image configuration dialog may now be closed by pressing Ctrl+return

	* Added a number of tooltips

	* Added a donate dialog, which makes it possible for people to
	donate money.

	* BUGFIX: when generating HTML, its no longer a problem if several
	images have the same base name, ie. if you may now generate
	holiday1/me.jpg andd holiday2/me.jpg at the same time.

	* BUGFIX: When the user presses the right mouse button on one of
	the list boxes containing options (Persons, Loactions, Keywords
	etc.) to show the context menu, then the state of the item was
	changed (from selected to non-selected or visa versa).

	* The total amount of images in the status bar is now updated when
	new images are found or existing images are deleted.

	* BUGFIX: don't load the search and multi-config images through
	the imageinfo clas as this will make KimDaBa ask whether date
	should be trusted.

	* Added a configuration option for whether EXIF rotation
	information should be used or not.

2004-01-23  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: It was not possible to generate HTML more than once per session.

	* Read date, orientation and description out of EXIF data.

2004-01-21  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Thanks to Teemu Rytilahti <teemu.rytilahti@kde-fi.org>, KimDaBa
	will now offer themes when generating HTML.

	* Heavily optimized browsing functions. Now everything is
	hopefully lightning fast.

2004-01-20  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* The thumbnail overview and the image viewer now has a menu item
	for invoking an external program on the images. The list includes
	all programs claiming they can handle image/jpeg from KTrader.

	* Implemented Maintenance/Display Images not on Disk

	* Implemented Maintenance/Recalculate Checksum (Useful if images
	has been change for example using gimp)

	* Implemented Maintenance/Rescan for new Images

	* Only do auto save if there has been changes since the last auto save.

2004-01-19  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* MD5 sums are now calculated for each image, so that KimDaBa can
	track movement of images in the directories

2004-01-18  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Move cursor to the lower right corner when viewer goes into fullscreen mode

	* BUGFIX: Generate HTML with nothing selected now export all
	images from thumbnail view.

	* BUGFIX: Context menu for thumbnail view used to show up in the
	browser too.

	* BUGFIX: searches using the textbox didn't work.

	* BUGFIX: ensure that tip of the day has focus when it starts up.

2004-01-10  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Improved HTML generation.

2004-01-04  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* The tool tip for the thumbnail view now contains an enlargement
	of the image. In addition the tool tip needs to be disabled,
	rather than it automatically hides. The tool tip window will
	temporarily hide when the mouse is outside the thumbnail view.
	The placement of the tool tip window is now improved, so it
	doesn't get partly of screen.

2004-01-03  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Added an item to the context menu in the viewer for setting the
	current image as the background. (Thanks to Teemu Rytilahti
	<teemu.rytilahti@kde-fi.org>) for a patch with this feature.

	* New Feature: It is now possible to show the content views (those
	with overview of persons, locations, keywords etc) either with a
	list view or with an icon view. In addition it is also possible to
	show a different icon for each item (one icon for Joe, and another
	for Bill).

2003-12-30  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: Member groups are not shown in the browser, in case the
	member group do not contain any items.

2003-12-26  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Update thumnail view when an image has been rotated.

	context menu for the thumbnail overview.

	* On public demand, the file name is now shown in the status bar.

2003-12-13  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: fixed crash where KimDaBa crashes if you right click outside
	an item in one of the list boxes with properties (Persons,
	Locations, ...)

2003-12-05  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: KimDaBa used to crash on moving images around.

2003-12-01  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* New Feature: Its now possible to drag(copy) images from kimdaba
	to say the desktop. Unfortunately KimDaBa crashes in KDE code if I
	drag an QImage out, so I can only drag the filename out, which
	means that rotated images are not rotated when dragged out. Still
	better than nothing ;-)


	* Go out of full screen if an item from the info box in the viewer
	is selected, and the viewer is on the same monitor as the browser.

	* Added Settings | Configure Shortcuts

	* Edit->Options was moved Settings->Configure Kimdaba.

	* New Feature: It is now possible to using fish:// or ftp:// when
	exporting to HTML

	* BUGFIX: Don't show HTML export dialog in case no item was selected.

---------------------------------- version 1.0 released --------------------
2003-11-27  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: Previously the image loader was asked to load all images
	on start up, making machines with low memory crash. This was
	clearly unintentional, and as such a bug.

2003-11-21  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: indicator marks are now properly shown during selection
	of drawing on images.

2003-11-13  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: File names did not contain an extension in the ThumbNail
	directory. This resulted in a name class if two files existed with
	same base name but different extension.

	* Completed the KimDaBa handbook.

	* BUGFIX: KimDaBa did always show one image less than the index promised.

	* IMPROVEMENT: Exchanged Ctrl+plus and Ctrl+minus in the viewer, so ctrl+plus
	now means run faster and ctrl+minus means run slower. This seems
	much more intuitive.

2003-10-21  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: First search for an image, then set properties, and the
	app crashed.

2003-10-05  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* BUGFIX: KimDaBa crashed when it found new images at start up.

	* Started writing a handbook for KimDaBa.

	* BUGFIX: if the slideshow was running very fast, then keyevents got utterly much
	  behind making it almost impossible to stop the slideshow.

	* Its now possible to configure image properties from within the viewer.

2003-10-04  Jesper K. Pedersen  <blackie@klaralvdalens-datakonsult.se>

	* Added new feature, which allows you to specify a default search
	option, that applies to all searches. That way you can exclude all
	private images, when looking at images with say, your parents.

	* BUGFIX: If a user added a new group, but never added any items
	to the group, then the group would not be available later for
	adding new items, but it was still available for selecting in
	configuration listbox and for searching.

	* BUGFIX: When a group was renamed or delete, the old name would still be
	available in the configuration listbox.

	* Added status bar icon for dirtyness.

	* BUGFIX: In the image config, selecting an item from the listbox
	did not mark the image dirty.

	* BUGFIX: Pressing Cancel in the find dialog, does no longer
	change the content of the browser window.
