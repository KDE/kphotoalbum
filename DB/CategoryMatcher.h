   \brief Base class for components of the image searching frame work.

   The matcher component must implement \ref eval which tells if the given
   image is matched by this component.

   If the over all search contains a "No other" part (as in Jesper and no
   other people", then we need to collect items of the category items seen. This,
   however, is rather expensive, so this collection is only turned on in
   that case.
