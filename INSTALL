A number of binary packages of KimDaBa is available from the home page at 
http://ktown.kde.org/kimdaba. You may want to have a look there before
proceeding compiling the sources yourself.

To install KimDaBa into your normal KDE setup, simply run
./configure
make
make install

If you want KimDaBa placed in a different directories take the following
steps. Below I assume /opt/KimDaBa for your instalation direction, replace
with your preference.

./configure --prefix=/opt/KimDaBa
make
make install

Next modify your ~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc, or whatever to include this line:
export KDEDIRS=/opt/KimDaBa:$KDEDIRS

In case of problems, please refer to the README file for further instructions.
