A number of binary packages of KPhotoAlbum is available from the home page at 
http://www.kphotoalbum.org. You may want to have a look there before
proceeding compiling the sources yourself.

========== prerequisites ==========

KPhotoAlbum supports different features which are realized using
external packages. All those packages are not strictly needed -
KPhotoAlbum can be build and will run without them, but the
corresponding features depend on them.

= "kipi" Plug-ins Support
You may among other things find plug-ins for:
- Writing images to cds or dvd's
- Adjusting timestamps on your images
- Making a calendar with your images in it
- Uploading your images to flickr
The plug-in library is called KIPI, and may be downloaded from the
KIPI Home page (http://extragear.kde.org/apps/kipi)

= EXIF support
Images store information like date image was shot, angle it was shot
with, focal length, and shutter time in what is know as EXIF
information.

KPhotoAlbum uses the EXIV2 library (http://freshmeat.net/projects/exiv2)
for reading EXIF information from images.

= SQL Database Support
KPhotoAlbum allows you to search using a certain number of EXIF
tags. For this KPhotoAlbum needs a Sqlite database. Unfortunately, for
this to work, you need to run Sqlite version 2.8.16, so please make
sure that the right version is installed on your system.
(you can get it from  http://www.sqlite.org/sqlite-2.8.16.tar.gz)
You can use CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS to direct configure to an alternative
place for this version of sqlite
e.g.
> export CPPFLAGS="-I/.../sqlite2.8.16/include"
> export LDFLAGS="-L/.../sqlite/2.8.16/lib"
> ./configure ....

In addition the qt package for sqlite (e.g.qt-sql-sqlite) must be
installed.

========== Installation: ==========

To install KPhotoAlbum into your normal KDE setup, simply run
./configure
make
make install

If you want KPhotoAlbum placed in a different directories take the following
steps. Below I assume /opt/KPhotoAlbum for your instalation direction, replace
with your preference.

./configure --prefix=/opt/KPhotoAlbum
make
make install

Next modify your ~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc, or whatever to include this line:
export KDEDIRS=/opt/KPhotoAlbum:$KDEDIRS

You can check the status of the different features using
KPhotoAlbum Feature Status from the Help menu when running KPhotoAlbum.


In case of problems, please refer to the README file for further instructions.
