TODO next
=========
- Add a message box with information about how the imageconfig window
works. (with a do-not-show-again checkbox)
- make it possible to find images with only a given set of persons on.
  The following syntax might do it: "A & B & None", would be the same as A
  & B and no one else.
- remember windows sizes so they can be restored on start up
- make it possible to disable the labels from the thumbnail views


==========================
BUGS To be handled soonish
==========================
- drawing on an image doesn't mark it as dirty
- Adding a new ListSelect will not show it up initially.
- Fix tab order in ImageConfig. I've tried fixing this several times, but
  this is not easy to get right, due to the windows may be located
  differently than their construction order. Here is the next plan:
  iterate through all the children of the dialog, and setup tab order as
  they are physically located on screen. 
- rework member group config page to use kdlistboxpair instead.
- when editing many images at a time, the time is deleted.

=======================
BUGS of less importance
=======================
- In the group editor (options->group), ensure that no cycles are created.
- Locking to dates doesn't seem to work, and once it works, the information
  should also be written to the XML file in ImageSearchInfo::toXML and ImageSearchInfo::load.
-It is possible to select the same filter option multiple times. This value 
 will then be displayed multiple times in the status bar

==============================
Features for a soonish version
==============================
- make it possible to select individual persons on images, and associate
  their names with that region - then generate an image map when generating
  HTML
- show slideshow in several Viewers, that is show image 1 in viewer 1, and
  image 2 in viewer 2, next show image 3 in viewer 1, and image 4 in viewer
  2. This would be very cool when the user as multiple monitors.
- Make a plugin structure for KimDaBa. (Will be in KimDaBa version 1.2)
- make KimDaBa a KPart (talk to cschum@suse.de, schumacher@kde.org)
- For removing properties:
  I think a good solution would be:

  Just delete the property from one or an image list with deselecting it.
  If there are 3 images selected, and one doesn't have the property,
  you can mark it grey.
  with clicking on it, it changes from white (delete from all)
  then marked (yellow in my kde-theme) - (set all)
  and again grey (leave as is)

  This is the behaviour of many programs with possibilities to select many 
  items and change some properties (mostly checkboxes)
- spell check in the editor

======================================================================
Features still to be considered (aka not likely to go in next release)
======================================================================
- Loseless image rotation (which actually affects the files)
- In search mode, radio buttons labeled "Or" and "And" should be available
  to tell how the items in the listbox should be combined.
- undo/redo
- when specifying options for several images at a time, present items that
  are on all images.
- Path could be a criteria in image search.
- add kio: kimdaba://places/house
- I really would like to do something with pictures found with image search. 
  E.g., I want to send them by email, but before I have to reduce them in size. 
  Therefore, most helpful would be (with decreasing importance):
  - copy to directory
  - move to directory (incl. thumbnails and updating the database)
  - create ascii list of path/filenames (this would allow making batch
- A Simple Export like HTML Export,
  but just to save the selected Images in a specific
  Size (+ Filetype) or just Original (even this would be great) to a directory 
  (great for sending as email, burning cd from an event)
  (Thus without index.html and thumbnails)
- polish the offline mode, so it might be able to ask for you mounting say
  a cd with the images needed.
- the search dialog does currently support &,|, and ! 
  (example Anne Helene & !Jesper )
  add support for parenthesis (example Spiff & ( Anne Helene | Jesper ) )
- make it possible to specify a pattern for directories to ignore, say .thumbs
- Viewer: make it optional if images should be sized up (that is don't scale
a 32x32 image to 1024x768)
