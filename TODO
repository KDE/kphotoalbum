- pan does work very well in the viewer
- drawing on an image doesn't mark it as dirty
- spell check in the editor
- drops from outside in thumnail view should simply be ignore or even
  warned about
- dropping in empty space in thumbnails doesn't work.
- In the group editor (options->group), ensure that no cycles are created.
- when images are deleted, the total count at the bottom of the mainwindow,
should update
- undo/redo
- read date and rotation out of the JPEG file info
- made it possible to select individual persons on images, and associate
  their names with that region - then generate an image map when exporting
  to HTML
- export/import of selection - thus make it possible to share part of
  KimDaBa databases
- show slideshow in several Viewers, that is show image 1 in viewer 1, and
  image 2 in viewer 2, next show image 3 in viewer 1, and image 4 in viewer
  2. This would be very cool when the user as multiple monitors.
- Display path/filename in status bar when hovering over an image
- Button for rescan directory tree and generate thumbnails. 
- when specifying options for several images at a time, present items that
  are on all images.
- Path could be a criteria in image search.
- add md5 sum to the DB that is used to re-find images if the DB is reordered.
- add kio: kimdaba://places/house

- Once a while I have identically looking pictures but a) in different path 
  or b) with different pixel dimensions. It would be nice if the tooltips 
  (Ctrl-T) could optionally show: path, filename, file size (kB), width and 
  height in pixels. 
  If I cannot get information about at least the filename, the label cannot be 
  used for other information.

- I really would like to do something with pictures found with image search. 
  E.g., I want to send them by email, but before I have to reduce them in size. 
  Therefore, most helpful would be (with decreasing importance):
  - copy to directory
  - move to directory (incl. thumbnails and updating the database)
  - create ascii list of path/filenames (this would allow making batch

- A Simple Export like HTML Export,
  but just to save the selected Images in a specific
  Size (+ Filetype) or just Original (even this would be great) to a directory 
  (great for sending as email, burning cd from an event)
  (Thus without index.html and thumbnails)

- view images in RMB.

- Refresh Button to redisplay Index 
  (after setting the rotation of some images)

- For removing properties:
  I think a good solution would be:

  Just delete the property from one or an image list with deselecting it.
  If there are 3 images selected, and one doesn't have the property,
  you can mark it grey.
  with clicking on it, it changes from white (delete from all)
  then marked (yellow in my kde-theme) - (set all)
  and again grey (leave as is)

  This is the behaviour of many programs with possibilities to select many 
  items and change some properties (mostly checkboxes)

- Loseless image rotation (which actually affects the files)

- Bug: searching with text from description field doesn't work

- add more descriptions to the demo.
