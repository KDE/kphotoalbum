TODO UTTERLY SOON

==========================
BUGS To be handled soonish
==========================
- drawing on an image doesn't mark it as dirty
- Adding a new ListSelect will not show it up initially.
- Fix tab order in ImageConfig. I've tried fixing this several times, but
  this is not easy to get right, due to the windows may be located
  differently than their construction order. Here is the next plan:
  iterate through all the children of the dialog, and setup tab order as
  they are physically located on screen. 

=======================
BUGS of less importance
=======================
- In the group editor (options->group), ensure that no cycles are created.

==============================
Features for a soonish version
==============================
- make it possible to select individual persons on images, and associate
  their names with that region - then generate an image map when generating
  HTML
- make KimDaBa a KPart (talk to cschum@suse.de, schumacher@kde.org)
- For removing properties:
  I think a good solution would be:

  Just delete the property from one or an image list with deselecting it.
  If there are 3 images selected, and one doesn't have the property,
  you can mark it grey.
  with clicking on it, it changes from white (delete from all)
  then marked (yellow in my kde-theme) - (set all)
  and again grey (leave as is)

  This is the behaviour of many programs with possibilities to select many 
  items and change some properties (mostly checkboxes)
- spell check in the editor
- make it possible to specify dates in other formats in the image config dialog
- Add a way to mark images using a single key stroke, something like:
  select a bunch of images, start the viewer in the viewer SPACE set some
  options for the image, and go to the next image, while RET just goes to the
  next image. (That way you can easily go through hundreds of images putting
  the keyword "print", and later search for keyword print for sending images
  to printer)
  This could of course be extended so you could set keywords with
  different key bindings (which should be configurable):
  (c) - image is from Copenhagen
  (l) - image is from Las Vegas.
  I doubt that extension will be very useful tho.
- rework member group config page to use kdlistboxpair instead.
- In the category editor, only populate the combo boxes with the
persons/locations/... that are on the current image.


======================================================================
Features still to be considered (aka not likely to go in next release)
======================================================================
- In search mode, radio buttons labeled "Or" and "And" should be available
  to tell how the items in the listbox should be combined.
- undo/redo
- when specifying options for several images at a time, present items that
  are on all images.
- Path could be a criteria in image search.
- add kio: kimdaba://places/house
- polish the offline mode, so it might be able to ask for you mounting say
  a cd with the images needed.
- the search dialog does currently support &,|, and ! 
  (example Anne Helene & !Jesper )
  add support for parenthesis (example Spiff & ( Anne Helene | Jesper ) )
- make it possible to specify a pattern for directories to ignore, say .thumbs
- Viewer: make it optional if images should be sized up (that is don't scale
a 32x32 image to 1024x768)
