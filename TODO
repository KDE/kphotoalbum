=================
TODO UTTERLY SOON
=================
The export feature currently saves in whatever is the current XML encoding
- that is no good, as this will make it save in uncompatible format.

==========================
BUGS To be handled soonish
==========================
- drawing on an image doesn't mark it as dirty
- Adding a new ListSelect will not show it up initially.
- renaming a category should not result in the listselect being placed
different in the image property page.
- Config window layout should be saved when a new tab has been created.
- the tips of the day screen only shows up randomly.
- When exporting to HTML or otherwise, use a filename suffix that
  matches what's actually being exported.  For example, exporting a
  file named foo.png generates a file named foo.png, even though the
  exported file is actually a JPEG.
- use exiv2 rather than kdeutil for reading EXIF info.

=======================
BUGS of less importance
=======================
- In the group editor (options->group), ensure that no cycles are created.
- When going back in the thumbnail view, the view is positioned at the top,
  rather than at its last current position.

==============================
Features for a soonish version
==============================
- make KimDaBa a KPart (talk to cschum@suse.de, schumacher@kde.org)
- For removing properties:
  I think a good solution would be:

  Just delete the property from one or an image list with deselecting it.
  If there are 3 images selected, and one doesn't have the property,
  you can mark it grey.
  with clicking on it, it changes from white (delete from all)
  then marked (yellow in my kde-theme) - (set all)
  and again grey (leave as is)

  This is the behaviour of many programs with possibilities to select many 
  items and change some properties (mostly checkboxes)
- make it possible to specify dates in other formats in the image config dialog
- improve the spelling support, so the user get the benefit of the config dialog.
- Find all images with changed checksums (rather than merely
  recompute the checksum).  This would help identify images
  requiring backup.
- Adding blinking icons to the splash screen.
- Choose a default category image, as Jean-Michel suggest (for category
  image of Anne Helene):
  Pick the first picture with ONLY Anne Helene (it´s likely to be more
  specific to recognize Anne Helene)
  If it doesn´t work, pick the first picture with Ann Helen
  If it doesn´t work, the default KDE icon, just like today.
  The problem here is speed. Currently it is not possible to load these images
  using the image manager, so say 300 images would take approx 1 minute to load.
- The image display window should show the zoom-factor in the
caption
- when using the back button, the window should position it correctly rather than at
the top of the view. Thus if I in a persons view select Pete, then when
going back to that persons view, Pete should be visible.
-  When no selection is active, pgup/pgdn in the viewer work as if all
pictures were selected.
- The "current image"/cursor are kept synchronized between the
  thumbnails navigator, the viewer, and the keyword editor (C-1). In
  particular, when hitting C-I while several images are selected,
  display first the image on which the cursor currently is.
- Use clickable breadcrumbs as commonly used on the web, where each
  level in the hierarchy is a clickable link, allowing the user to
  easily go back multiple levels with one click.  On the web they often
  appear something like this:
  Shopping >> Men's Clothing >> Outdoor gear
- In the viewer it should be possible to click on the date, and get it to
limit to that date.
- Store URI in the XML file rather than relative names from a root dir.
  Advantages are:
  - It'd be possible to have the xml-file somewhere completely outside of
    the image-tree so that you could, for example, have the images
    themselves on a read-only media.  
  - It'd be possible to work with a image-directory accessed over any of
    the protocols for which there are kioslaves.  
  - It'd be possible to include images from more than one directory.

- red eye removal (See email from Martin Ehmsen <martin@ehmsen.org>)

- items in the browsers should be case insensitive
- make it possible in the browser to select multiple images to form an "or query"
- make it possible to specify sort order for the thumbnail (newest image
first or last)

======================================================================
Features still to be considered (aka not likely to go in next release)
======================================================================
- when specifying options for several images at a time, present items that
  are on all images.
- add kio: kimdaba://places/house
- polish the offline mode, so it might be able to ask for you mounting say
  a cd with the images needed.
- make it possible to specify a pattern for directories to ignore, say .thumbs
- Viewer: make it optional if images should be sized up (that is don't scale
a 32x32 image to 1024x768)
- Export preserves folder layout.  This would be very helpful for
  exporting a set of images for purpose of mirroring them, or for
  backing them up to DVD's in a form that I could easily use to
  restore them later.  The scenario would be that I would select all
  images not previously backed up (by means of a keyword) and export
  them preserving layout, and dump the exported tree to DVD.
- add a DCOP interface to KimDaBa
- Predefined filtering, or "dynamic selection" : let the user define
  a selection and display it. This gives the advantage of not having to
  manually having to set a given keyword to the new images corresponding
  to this selection.
- display the current "location" in the status bar, something like
  Paris > StreetArt > Invaders
  and the ability to click on them to remove them from the filter
  (enlarging the selection).
- Lots of people are asking for an extension of the token feature. One
  useful extension could be this:
  In the viewer make it possible to show up a dialog that allows user to
  move tokens to items in the categories. That way I could add "Jesper" to
  all images with the token "J". This would allow me to shortcut the step
  of going out of the viewer, into the token editor, just to search for all
  images with token "j", and then set person Jesper on these.
- I find that when I'm adding tokens to a set of pictures, it is frequently the
  case that the tokens I want to apply to a picture are exactly (or close to)
  the same tokens I set for the last picture. So a single character (maybe '/'
  or some other non-token character) to duplicate the previous pictures tokens
  would be a wonderful time-saver.
