==========================
BUGS To be handled soonish
==========================
- pan doesn't work very well in the viewer
- drawing on an image doesn't mark it as dirty
- when renaming an item in the listselect, then category image should also
  be renamed.
- Adding a new ListSelect will not show it up initially.
- Fix tab order in ImageConfig. I've tried fixing this several times, but
  this is not easy to get right, due to the windows may be located
  differently than third construction order. Here is the next plan:
  iterate through all the children of the dialog, and setup tab order as
  they are physically located on screen. 
- rotating an image in the viewer is not written to the database.
-I do not like the way dates are entered. I prefer the way (korganizer and  
 kaddressbook) do it: to write them in one single text field and to offer a 
 calender as well.
- the viewer should allow you to close it by hitting q.
- The first one deals with the options dialog. Here I've defined a new category 
  (for example animals). When I then go to the member groups configuration, the 
  new categories are missing. They need a program restart to appear.
=======================
BUGS of less importance
=======================
- In the group editor (options->group), ensure that no cycles are created.
- when images are deleted, the total count at the bottom of the mainwindow,
  should update
- Locking to dates doesn't seem to work, and once it works, the information
  should also be written to the XML file in ImageSearchInfo::toXML and ImageSearchInfo::load.
-It is possible to select the same filter option multiple times. This value 
 will then be displayed multiple times in the status bar

==============================
Features for a soonish version
==============================
- make it possible to select individual persons on images, and associate
  their names with that region - then generate an image map when generating
  HTML
- show slideshow in several Viewers, that is show image 1 in viewer 1, and
  image 2 in viewer 2, next show image 3 in viewer 1, and image 4 in viewer
  2. This would be very cool when the user as multiple monitors.
- Loseless image rotation (which actually affects the files)
- Make a plugin structure for KimDaBa. (Will be in KimDaBa version 1.2)
- Add a message box with information about how the imageconfig window
works. (with a do-not-show-again checkbox)
- make KimDaBa a KPart (talk to cschum@suse.de, schumacher@kde.org)
- add Maintenance/remove all thumbnails and Maintenance/regenerate all thumbnails.

======================================================================
Features still to be considered (aka not likely to go in next release)
======================================================================
- undo/redo
- spell check in the editor
- export/import of selection - thus make it possible to share part of
  KimDaBa databases
- For removing properties:
  I think a good solution would be:

  Just delete the property from one or an image list with deselecting it.
  If there are 3 images selected, and one doesn't have the property,
  you can mark it grey.
  with clicking on it, it changes from white (delete from all)
  then marked (yellow in my kde-theme) - (set all)
  and again grey (leave as is)

  This is the behaviour of many programs with possibilities to select many 
  items and change some properties (mostly checkboxes)
- when specifying options for several images at a time, present items that
  are on all images.
- Path could be a criteria in image search.
- add kio: kimdaba://places/house
- I really would like to do something with pictures found with image search. 
  E.g., I want to send them by email, but before I have to reduce them in size. 
  Therefore, most helpful would be (with decreasing importance):
  - copy to directory
  - move to directory (incl. thumbnails and updating the database)
  - create ascii list of path/filenames (this would allow making batch
- A Simple Export like HTML Export,
  but just to save the selected Images in a specific
  Size (+ Filetype) or just Original (even this would be great) to a directory 
  (great for sending as email, burning cd from an event)
  (Thus without index.html and thumbnails)
- polish the offline mode, so it might be able to ask for you mounting say
  a cd with the images needed.
- the search dialog does currently support &,|, and ! 
  (example Anne Helene & !Jesper )
  add support for parenthesis (example Spiff & ( Anne Helene | Jesper ) )
- A feature where you can set how much time the Info Box will be present on an 
  image during a Slide Show. The time could be proportional to the delay 
  between slides. For example:
  Delay between slides: 10s
  Info Box present during: 50% of the time  
  So, after five seconds the Info will Box vanish.
- A menu point for removeing all Thumbs (for storing the pictures on CD)
- A menu point for removeing all Thumbs (for storing the pictures on CD)
- Viewer: Sort the order of Person names "Alice" before "Bob"
-Viewer: I would like to add a kind of passport picture to some persons/
 locations they could be displayed as mouseover effects on their name. I made 
 something like this on a webpage: www.kellerkinder.de.gg (it is in german, 
 but just klick on one thumbnail, and afterwards put the mouse over the names 
 after "Bildquelle" or "Zu sehen" below the picture)
- make it possible to specify a pattern for directories to ignore, say .thumbs
