==========
IPTC stuff
==========
- re-think the whole idea (qt4's scripting?)
- encoding
- add support for writing to another file (and extend the File->Export/Copy
  images dialog to match this feature)

=================
TODO UTTERLY SOON
=================
- Now that we have videos in KPA calculating md5 for the whole file takes a
long time. Instead I should just do for parts of the file, say the first
1k, then 10th 1k the 100th 1k etc
- Also MD5 sum calculation should be done on a thread.
- The person, location and keywords window are hidden by the main window
(if torn off) when the mouse moves over the main window (the main window is risen).
- Its impossible to do multiple selection as part of the same selection in
the thumbnail view (select one range, press ctrl and select a second to be
part of the first)
- Typing in "Maj 1999" in for a date in the annotation dialog (assuming
danish is the current locale), result in the test "May 1999" being
replaced. This is of course wrong,as replacing 1999 with 2000 result in a
parse error of the date.

==========================
BUGS To be handled soonish
==========================
- Adding a new ListSelect will not show it up initially.
- renaming a category should not result in the listselect being placed
different in the image property page.
- Config window layout should be saved when a new tab has been created.

================================================================
Features I like, and wish I would have time to look at some day.
================================================================
- make KPhotoAlbum a KPart (talk to cschum@suse.de, schumacher@kde.org)
- make it possible to specify dates in other formats in the image config dialog
- improve the spelling support, so the user get the benefit of the config dialog.
- Find all images with changed checksums (rather than merely
  recompute the checksum).  This would help identify images
  requiring backup.
- Choose a default category image, as Jean-Michel suggest (for category
  image of Anne Helene):
  Pick the first picture with ONLY Anne Helene (it´s likely to be more
  specific to recognize Anne Helene)
  If it doesn´t work, pick the first picture with Ann Helen
  If it doesn´t work, the default KDE icon, just like today.
  The problem here is speed. Currently it is not possible to load these images
  using the image manager, so say 300 images would take approx 1 minute to load.
- Use clickable breadcrumbs as commonly used on the web, where each
  level in the hierarchy is a clickable link, allowing the user to
  easily go back multiple levels with one click.  On the web they often
  appear something like this:
  Shopping >> Men's Clothing >> Outdoor gear
- In the viewer it should be possible to click on the date, and get it to
limit to that date.
- Store URI in the XML file rather than relative names from a root dir.
  Advantages are:
  - It'd be possible to have the xml-file somewhere completely outside of
    the image-tree so that you could, for example, have the images
    themselves on a read-only media.  
  - It'd be possible to work with a image-directory accessed over any of
    the protocols for which there are kioslaves.  
  - It'd be possible to include images from more than one directory.

- red eye removal (See email from Martin Ehmsen <martin@ehmsen.org>)

- items in the browsers should be case insensitive
- make it possible in the browser to select multiple images to form an "or query"
- when specifying options for several images at a time, present items that
  are on all images.

======================================================================
Features still to be considered (aka not likely to go in next release)
======================================================================
- add kio: kphotoalbum://places/house
- Viewer: make it optional if images should be sized up (that is don't scale
a 32x32 image to 1024x768)
- Export preserves folder layout.  This would be very helpful for
  exporting a set of images for purpose of mirroring them, or for
  backing them up to DVD's in a form that I could easily use to
  restore them later.  The scenario would be that I would select all
  images not previously backed up (by means of a keyword) and export
  them preserving layout, and dump the exported tree to DVD.
- add a DCOP interface to KPhotoAlbum
- Predefined filtering, or "dynamic selection" : let the user define
  a selection and display it. This gives the advantage of not having to
  manually having to set a given keyword to the new images corresponding
  to this selection.
- display the current "location" in the status bar, something like
  Paris > StreetArt > Invaders
  and the ability to click on them to remove them from the filter
  (enlarging the selection).
