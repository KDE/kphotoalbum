==========================
BUGS To be handled soonish
==========================
- pan doesn't work very well in the viewer
- drawing on an image doesn't mark it as dirty
- add more descriptions to the demo.
- escape quotes and back quotes in descriptions when generating HTML
- it seems like its not possible to generate HTML twice with different
  images, without restarting the program
- when renaming an item in the listselect, then category image should also
  be renamed.
- Adding a new ListSelect will not show it up initially.
- Add a README file to the tar balls.
- Fix tab order in ImageConfig, plus make Ctrl+Enter press OK

=======================
BUGS of less importance
=======================
- In the group editor (options->group), ensure that no cycles are created.
- when images are deleted, the total count at the bottom of the mainwindow,
  should update

==============================
Features for a soonish version
==============================
- Button for rescan directory tree and generate thumbnails. 
- read date and rotation out of the JPEG file info (AKA EXIF info)
- make it possible to select individual persons on images, and associate
  their names with that region - then generate an image map when generating
  HTML
- show slideshow in several Viewers, that is show image 1 in viewer 1, and
  image 2 in viewer 2, next show image 3 in viewer 1, and image 4 in viewer
  2. This would be very cool when the user as multiple monitors.
- Loseless image rotation (which actually affects the files)
- add a kpart call for editing images.

======================================================================
Features still to be considered (aka not likely to go in next release)
======================================================================
- undo/redo
- spell check in the editor
- export/import of selection - thus make it possible to share part of
  KimDaBa databases
- For removing properties:
  I think a good solution would be:

  Just delete the property from one or an image list with deselecting it.
  If there are 3 images selected, and one doesn't have the property,
  you can mark it grey.
  with clicking on it, it changes from white (delete from all)
  then marked (yellow in my kde-theme) - (set all)
  and again grey (leave as is)

  This is the behaviour of many programs with possibilities to select many 
  items and change some properties (mostly checkboxes)
- when specifying options for several images at a time, present items that
  are on all images.
- Path could be a criteria in image search.
- add kio: kimdaba://places/house
- I really would like to do something with pictures found with image search. 
  E.g., I want to send them by email, but before I have to reduce them in size. 
  Therefore, most helpful would be (with decreasing importance):
  - copy to directory
  - move to directory (incl. thumbnails and updating the database)
  - create ascii list of path/filenames (this would allow making batch
- A Simple Export like HTML Export,
  but just to save the selected Images in a specific
  Size (+ Filetype) or just Original (even this would be great) to a directory 
  (great for sending as email, burning cd from an event)
  (Thus without index.html and thumbnails)
- polish the offline mode, so it might be able to ask for you mounting say
  a cd with the images needed.
