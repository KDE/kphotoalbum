TODO UTTERLY SOON

==========================
BUGS To be handled soonish
==========================
- drawing on an image doesn't mark it as dirty
- Adding a new ListSelect will not show it up initially.
- renaming a category should not result in the listselect being placed
different in the image property page.
- searching for jan 02 2003 in the demo should yield img015, but no images
  are found.

- Config window layout should be saved when a new tab as been created.
- the tips of the day screen only shows up randomly.

=======================
BUGS of less importance
=======================
- In the group editor (options->group), ensure that no cycles are created.

==============================
Features for a soonish version
==============================
- make it possible to select individual persons on images, and associate
  their names with that region - then generate an image map when generating
  HTML
- make KimDaBa a KPart (talk to cschum@suse.de, schumacher@kde.org)
- For removing properties:
  I think a good solution would be:

  Just delete the property from one or an image list with deselecting it.
  If there are 3 images selected, and one doesn't have the property,
  you can mark it grey.
  with clicking on it, it changes from white (delete from all)
  then marked (yellow in my kde-theme) - (set all)
  and again grey (leave as is)

  This is the behaviour of many programs with possibilities to select many 
  items and change some properties (mostly checkboxes)
- make it possible to specify dates in other formats in the image config dialog
- rework member group config page to use kdlistboxpair instead.
- improve the spelling support, so the user get the benefit of the config dialog.
- Find all images with changed checksums (rather than merely
  recompute the checksum).  This would help identify images
  requiring backup.
- Adding blinking icons to the splash screen.
- Choose a default category image, as Jean-Michel suggest (for category
  image of Anne Helene):
  Pick the first picture with ONLY Anne Helene (it´s likely to be more
  specific to recognize Anne Helene)
  If it doesn´t work, pick the first picture with Ann Helen
  If it doesn´t work, the default KDE icon, just like today.
- Make it possible to use the thumbnail standard
  (http://jens.triq.net/thumbnail-spec/) 

======================================================================
Features still to be considered (aka not likely to go in next release)
======================================================================
- In search mode, radio buttons labeled "Or" and "And" should be available
  to tell how the items in the listbox should be combined.
- when specifying options for several images at a time, present items that
  are on all images.
- add kio: kimdaba://places/house
- polish the offline mode, so it might be able to ask for you mounting say
  a cd with the images needed.
- make it possible to specify a pattern for directories to ignore, say .thumbs
- Viewer: make it optional if images should be sized up (that is don't scale
a 32x32 image to 1024x768)
- Export preserves folder layout.  This would be very helpful for
  exporting a set of images for purpose of mirroring them, or for
  backing them up to DVD's in a form that I could easily use to
  restore them later.  The scenario would be that I would select all
  images not previously backed up (by means of a keyword) and export
  them preserving layout, and dump the exported tree to DVD.
