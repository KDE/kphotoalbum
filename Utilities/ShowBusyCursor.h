/**
   \brief Utility class to set/unset the busy cursor

   When setting the busy cursor, you also need to remember to unset it
   again, otherwise you will have a busy cursor for the rest of the
   lifetime of the application.

   This class helps you avoid not getting it unset due to an early return
   in a function (much similar to \ref BooleanGuard). The code looks like
   this:

   <pre>
   void f() {
       ...
       ShowBusyCursor dummy;
       ... // cursor will be busy until the end of this function.
   }
   </pre>
**/



class ShowBusyCursor {

public:
    ShowBusyCursor(Qt::CursorShape shape = Qt::WaitCursor );
    ~ShowBusyCursor();
    void stop();
private:
    bool _active;
};

}

#endif /* SHOWBUSYCURSOR_H */
