   One of the things that made it harder to learn KPhotoAlbum in the past
   was that its vocabulary did not match that of similar application, and
   it was not use coherently throughout the application and
   documentation.

   One reason for that is of course that it is not like similar
   applications, but of course also because that the authors were not
   sufficiently aware of the importance of using a consistent
   vocabulary. Usability literature tells us that it is very confusing to
   the user if the same concept is described using different words in
   different contexts.

   It is an ongoing process to unify KPhotoAlbum to a common vocabulary, so
   if there is a concept not described here, then please discuss it on the
   mailing list and/or IRC channel, and then later add it here.
