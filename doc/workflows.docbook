  <title>Workflows with &kphotoalbum;</title>
  <para>Workflow is rather important aspect in digital imaging. In this
  chapter we describe different workflows that fit on different needs.
  There are many different factors that must be considered when
  developing a workflow. Hopefully these examples will provide you with
  sufficient ideas of how to tune-up your own method of working with
  digital imaging.</para>

  <sect1 id="raw-workflow">
  <title>RAW workflow using &kphotoalbum; and Bibble5</title>
  <para>When shooting RAW images the files from camera must be developed
  to commonly recognized format like JPEG or TIFF. There are a few
  options to choose from when working on Linux. For example RawTherapee
  and Ufraw are open-source alternatives when Bibble5/AfterShotPro are
  commercial application for this purpose.</para>

  <para>A few settings are recommended for a RAW workflow.
  First is to enable the using of the embedded thumbnail. This will give
  a tremendous speed boost over decoding each raw file each time they are
  viewed (check also the minimum dimension configuration to ensure decent
  quality). Second one is for the New Image Finder to automatically stack the
  developed versions over the RAW file (developed image must be on same
  directory as the original). This requires regular expressions as
  described in <xref linkend="opt-search-new" />. Two helper scripts are
  provided in &kphotoalbum; sources to help in RAW workflow. These are
  open-raw.desktop and open-raw.pl. The first one enables GUI applications to
  open the RAW files in the open-raw.pl script that tries to find the original
  RAW file and open that instead of the developed image.
  </para>

    <title>Sending Images to RAW Editor</title>
    <mediaobject>
      <imageobject>
        <imagedata fileref="raw-external.png" format="PNG"/>
        </imageobject>
      </mediaobject>
  </figure>

  <para>First step in actual workflow is to copy the images from camera to the
  computer. A simple copy on a terminal window is all that is needed:
  </para>
  <screen><userinput><command>cp</command> <option>-a</option> <filename>/media/.../101CANON/</filename> <filename>~/Pictures/2012/sample</filename>
  </userinput></screen>
  <para>
  Then either start &kphotoalbum; or run
  <menuchoice><guimenu>Maintenance</guimenu><guimenuitem>Rescan for
  Images and Videos</guimenuitem></menuchoice>. New images should be
  found and now is time for initially tagging the images. As I usually photograph while
  traveling I first insert the place. Select <guilabel>Folder</guilabel>
  and browse to the new directory. Then go to the
  <guilabel>Show Thumbnails</guilabel>, select all
  and <guimenu>Annotate Multiple Items at a Time</guimenu> or <keycombo
  action="simul">&Ctrl;<keycap>2</keycap></keycombo>. Insert the
  proper place like Finland-Helsinki (see <xref
  linkend="sec-member-groups-in-property-editor"/>).
  </para>

  <para>Now that the new images are easy to find I do the
  initial ranking and deletion. For this I go to the thumbnail
  view and start the Viewer by hitting &Enter;. I use
  rating for good images, just press the appropriate number from
  <keycap>1</keycap> to <keycap>5</keycap>. I only give 3 to 5 ratings
  and hit <keycombo
  action="simul">&Ctrl;<keycap>Del</keycap></keycombo>
  for the bad photos to delete them. At this point I might add also
  People names if there happens to be a diver in the photo. Once the
  first round is done I exit the Viewer by hitting &Esc;
  and select <guimenuitem>Delete file from disk</guimenuitem> to get rid off the
  bad images for good.
  </para>

  <para>Next I select only the images that have high enough rating using
  the search function. Naturally the Place has to be set if search is
  started with <keycombo
  action="simul">&Ctrl;<keycap>F</keycap></keycombo>.
  However, if search is invoked from the Main Window the current
  selection is drilled down to the more precise match. Anyway, at this
  point I go through the better rated images again doing refining on the
  rating. E.g. if I have 5 similar photos of one Nudibranch species I
  generally decrease the rating of the poorer images and might increase
  the best one. Comparing images can be done by selecting the ones you
  want to compare and starting the Viewer. Removing images from the
  Viewer selection can be done with <keycap>Delete</keycap>. This only
  disables the viewing of the current image while within the Viewer,
  nothing is removed or deleted. This allows comparing 2 or 3 better
  images next to each other moving between them with
  <keycap>PgUp</keycap> and <keycap>PgDn</keycap>. I quite commonly use
  a <literal>tmp</literal> category to mark &eg; crabs and shrimps to be
  easily able to display only selected type of images during the later
  phases of selection and identification.</para>

  <para>After a reduced amount of images is left I start tagging them. I
  add the Latin Name of the species and Common Name. Whenever I have
  these two categories completed I consider the image Done and get rid
  of the Untagged marking. (As the tags are copied over to new version
  of images only when the new image is found and not when the top of the
  stack is re-tagged it is good to have as final tagging done as
  possible before developing JPEGs.)</para>

  <para>The best images are sent to external application for developing.
  With wanted images selected, right click on selected thumbnail and
  select <menuchoice><guimenuitem>Invoke External
  Program</guimenuitem><guimenuitem>All Selected
  Images</guimenuitem><guimenuitem>Send
  Bibble5</guimenuitem></menuchoice>. The application
  selected is actually my script that detects if there is a RAW file for
  the possibly already developed images available and uses that if possible.
  Within the external application I do some tuning up and cropping if
  required and then output the developed JPEGs next to the original RAW file.
  File naming is rather simple, change the extension or add underscore
  and running number if needed.
  </para>

  <para>Now that there is plenty of new JPEGs in the image directories I
  let &kphotoalbum; search for new images and automatically stack the
  new ones on top of the original RAW (<xref linkend="fig-options-file-versions" />).
  Then a final round of selection with the developed images and adding some
  descriptions if needed.</para>

  <para>Final step is to generate static &HTML; pages and upload to my web
  server for the enjoyment of friends and colleagues. &HTML; generation is
  described in <xref linkend="chp-generating-html"/>.</para>
