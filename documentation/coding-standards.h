/**
   \page coding-standards Coding Standards

   Here are a few pointers regarding coding standards in
   KPhotoAlbum. Please do stick to them, so the code is easier to get into
   few new people, and easier to maintain for everyone.

   \li Indentation is 4 spaces
   \li Instance variables are prefixed either with an underscore or
   m_. Please stick to one of the two for a given class.
   \li Methods that are overriden from a superclass should be marked with
   the macro OVERRIDE. This macro expands to nothing, so it is purely for
   bringing to peoples attention that this is actually overriding a method.
