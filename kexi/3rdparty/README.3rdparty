Kexi 3rdparty directory contents
--------------------------------

Purpose: Any kexi-independent code goes here.

kexisql/ - database engine (SQLite3) implementation taken "as-is" from SQLite project (www.sqlite.org)
     We use kexisql name for indication that original SQLite sources can be changed
     by Kexi programmers from-version-to-version without notice. "original"
     SQLite db implementation library won't be in conflict with kexisql lib 
     (we use other naming).
kexisql2/ - database engine (SQLite2). As above, but this is older version provided for handling older, 
      incompatible file format.


Currently unused:

uuid/ - unique number generator from e2fsprogs, used for creating unique 
     identifers across databases and for local objects
