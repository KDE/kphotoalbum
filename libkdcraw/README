-- INSTALL ------------------------------------------------------------

In order to compile, especially when QT3/Qt4 are installed at the same time, 
just use something like that:

# export VERBOSE=1
# export QTDIR=/usr/lib/qt4/  
# export PATH=$QTDIR/bin:$PATH 
# cmake .
# make

Usual CMake options :

-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX : decide where the program will be install on your computer.
-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE     : decide which type of build you want. You can chose between "debugfull", "debug", "profile", "relwithdebinfo" and "release". The default is "relwithdebinfo" (-O2 -g).

Compared to old KDE3 autoconf options:

"cmake . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=debugfull" is equivalent to "./configure --enable-debug=full"
"cmake . -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr"  is equivalent to "./configure --prefix=/usr"
