Description
===========

Originally, KPhotoAlbum shipped with the standard categories "Keywords",
"Locations", and "Persons".  These were at some point replaced with the
standard categories "Events", "Places", and "People".

While "Keywords" and "Events" are not a one-to-one match and can therefore not
be renamed automatically, "Locations" and "Persons" were automatically
translated, with extra bookkeeping to make sure newer code worked well with the
old standard names.

To make matters more complex, some versions of KPhotoAlbum stored the localized
names of the standard categories into the database.

Beginning with database format version 6, the old names loose their "special"
meaning and are handled just like every other user-created category.
