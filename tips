<p>It is possible to create new categories - that are alternatives
to <b>Person</b>, <b>Location</b>, and <b>Keywords</b> - in the image
property page. Simply go to the <tt>Settings->Configure KimDaBa</tt> dialog to add your own, or
delete one of the existing ones.</p>

<p>You may rename or delete a person, location, keyword or similar by
right-clicking on the item in the image property dialog.</p>

<p>When generating HTML you must specify a base directory for
the images. Here you can specify any <a
href="help:/kioslave/index.html">protocol</a> supported by KDE, like ftp or
fish.</p>
<p>Examples:
<ul>
  <li> ftp://someserver/my-upload-area/images (upload using FTP)
  <li> fish://someserver/home/foo/images (upload using ssh)
  <li> smb://someserver/c/images (upload to a Windows share)
</ul>

<p>When you bring new images to your collection, you might not have time
right away to categorize them (i.e. specify Persons, Locations,
etc.). Therefore, you might later want to find those images which have not
yet been categorized. Here is what I do:</p> 
<p>I use the <tt>keyword</tt> <tt>OK</tt>, which I set on images, once I've
categorized them. (i.e. just like you may have a keyword for <tt>Summer
Party</tt> or <tt>Interrail trip 1990</tt>, you now have a keyword
<tt>OK</tt>). To find uncategorized images, I choose the
<tt>Search</tt> item from the browser, and in the keywords line edit, I
type <tt>!OK</tt>. This will find all images which do <b>not</b> have the
<tt>OK</tt> item.

<p>You can reorder images on your hard disk after having loaded them into
KimDaBa - KimDaBa will still remember them, as it calculates checksums for
the images.</p>

<p>In the image-properties, keywords, persons and locations (as well as 
any additional properties you define) are sorted so that the most 
recently used are at the top, making it convenient to tag several 
similar images.</p>

<p>It's possible to associate images with
persons/locations/keywords/etc. That way when browsing, say persons, you
may get a small icon for each person with e.g. the person's face.</p>
<p>To specify an icon for a person, load the person in the viewer, zoom to
the part which you want to make into an icon, and choose
<tt>Show Category Editor</tt>. This will bring up a dialog where you can
find the person, and set the image.

<p>You may close the image configuration dialog by pressing Ctrl+Enter.

<p>You may make groups of, say, persons by selecting <tt>Settings->Configure
KimDaBa</tt>, and then choosing the tab <tt>Member Groups</tt>.</p>
<p> That way you can make a group called <tt>Family</tt>, which includes
all the persons in your family. When browsing, each individual
person will still be available when choosing the <tt>Persons</tt> icon, but in
addition an item labeled <tt>Family</tt> will be available. When selecting
that item, pictures including <b>any</b> of the persons from your family
will be shown.

<p>KimDaBa is pronounced Ki'da'ba (the 'm' is not pronounced - hey I'm
the author I can come up with these weird rules!). KimDaBa stands for <b>KDE</b>
<b>Im</b>age <b>Da</b>ta<b>ba</b>se. Originally I wanted it to just be KiDaBa, but I
then found that it looked to much like kid-aba, and the name suggested that
it was an algebra program for kids.</p>

<p>You may reorder images by dragging and dropping one image onto
another. If you drop it on the left edge, it will end up in front of
the other, if you drop it on the right edge it will be inserted behind.</p>
