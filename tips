<p>When generating HTML you must specify a base directory for
the images. Here you may specify any <a
href="help:/kioslave/index.html">protocol</a> supported by KDE, like ftp or
fish.</p>
<p>Examples:
<ul>
  <li> ftp://someserver/my-upload-area/images (upload using FTP)
  <li> fish://someserver/home/foo/images (upload using ssh)
  <li> smb://someserver/c/images (upload to a Windows share)
</ul>

<p>You can reorder images on your hard disk after having loaded them into
KimDaBa - KimDaBa will still remember them, as it calculates check sums for
the images.</p>

<p>It's possible to associate images for
persons/locations/keywords/etc. That way when browsing, say persons, you
may get a small icon for each person with e.g. the persons face.</p>
<p>To specify an icon for a person, load the person in the viewer, zoom to
the part which you want to make an icon, and choose
<tt>Show Category Editor</tt>, which will bring up a dialog where you can
find the person, and set the image.

<p>You may make groups of, say persons by selecting <tt>Settings|Configure
KimDaBa</tt>, and the choosing the tab <tt>Member Groups</tt>.</p>
<p> That way you can make a group called <tt>Family</tt>, which includes
all the persons you are in family with. When browsing, each individual
person will still be available when choosing the <tt>Persons</tt> icon, but in
addition an item labeled <tt>Family</tt> will be available. When selecting
that item pictures including <b>any</b> of the persons from your family
will be shown.

<p>KimDaBa is pronounced Ki'da'ba (the m is not pronounced - hey I'm
the author I can come up with these weird rules!). KimDaBa stands for <b>KDE</b>
<b>Im</b>age <b>Da</b>tabase. Originally I wanted it to just be KiDaBa, but I
then found that it looked to much like kid-aba, and the name suggested that
it was an algebra program for kids.</p>
